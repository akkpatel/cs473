Subject: sum of chinese speech errors

about 2 weeks ago i sent a query to linguist list asking for references on the topic of speech errors in chinese . thanks to all those ( 9 ) who have kindly replied with information , advice and questions . i am pleased that there are people out there who are very interested in this topic , but disappointed to find that so little research has been reportedly done in this field . i have read a few papers on errors in chinese handwriting , but not so much so on reported oral errors . to sum up the references i got so far from the linguist list : ( 1 ) shen , jiaxuan . ' kou wu lei lei ' , zhongguo yuwen , 1992 . 4 . ( 2 ) moser , david . ' slips of the tongue and pen in chinese ' , sino - platonic papers , no . 22 , 1991 . i am grateful that some responses have promised to keep looking for further references , but i am still wondering about one question that i keep asking myself : do chinese speakers make speech errors at all ? and if they do , do they err remarkably less than , say , english speakers ? thank you . yang wei dept of linguistics university of victoria

Subject: summary : who animal

i would like to thank all those who wrote in concerning the question of whether ' who ' or ' what ' is used to ask about species of animals in various languages ( i am sorry but at the moment i cannot locate the file with the names of all those who i need to thank , but i am really grateful ) . the only language so far identified which uses the equivalent of ' who ' in this situation in russian , while german , danish , french , dutch , and i am pretty sure ( although my judgements are somewhat rusty here ) polish all use ' what ' , as does english obviously . i should add that i have seen many russian linguists ' dxescriptions of other languages in which they note that whatever the language is , that it uses ' what ' rather than than ' who ' for animals . most recently , i saw this in an eskimo - russain dictionary . i would be interested in hearing about any more examples of a language that uses ' who ' to ask for the species of an animal , as in ' what / who is that ' , when looking at an animal in a zoo , or ' what / who bit you ? ' , looking at a someone 's swollen arm .

re analogy : benji wald asks syntax teachers to comment on his contribution . i think his characterisation of syntax teaching is a little harsh . i for one do not expect students ( at any level ) to accept my ( or anyone else 's ) grammaticality judgements unquestioningly . i ' m sure there are many syntax teachers who would prefer to get students to give their own judgements of e . g . : 1 ) i saw the grass brown when i was on holiday in spain 2 ) if you see the tower hazy , it means it ' ll rain tomorrow 3 ) only sherlock saw the man lame one might then ask for a comparison with the acceptability status of : 4 ) i saw the grass wilting . . . 5 ) if you see the tower leaning . . . . . 6 ) only sherlock saw the man limping . i ' m sure there are plenty of syntax teachers who would find it important to explore reasons why 1 - 3 ) might be less acceptable than 1 - 6 ) on the basis of the students ' own judgements . richard ingham

Subject: eskimo words for " snow " , " ice " , etc .

as an eskimologist and an anthropologist , i strongly concur with woodbury 's and hill 's recent messages on the topic . i have two responses : one to the person who suggested that maybe what was peculiar about eskimo words for snow is not the number of lexical items to be found in a dictionary , but rather that these words are used more often and even by non-specialists within the culture . i am sorry that i can't track down the name of this person , which i must have deleted by mistake . but this is an interesting idea . my answer is that eskimos talk about snow about as often as a sahara tuareg would talk about rain , in other words , not very often . remember that the arctic is technically a desert ; i . e . there is very little precipitation , although whatever snow that does fall remains on the ground , an ~ rd is blown a } iround into funny shapes , for which there is of course , a technical terminology , used mainly by huntersd who need to use these things as landmarks . snow ( as a ground cover or falling ) is really not very important to eskimos . i suggest that we start looking at some of the languages of the subarctic groups of canada ( cree , chipewyan ) , these people live in deep snow , and probably talk about it a lot more ! my second response is for george fowler who suggest that there might be an fashion of eskimo words for - - - - - going on . he talks about 50 words for ice in greenlandic . he was speaking facetiously , of course , but there is a point to be made here . eskimos who hunt on ice ( such as the siberian yupik eskimos i worked with ) have an incredibly detailed technical terminology for ice conditions , icebergs , ice thickness and movements . for eskimo hunters , these things are concretely a matter of life and death . so eskimos do have many words for ice , and as for snow , this is a technical terminology , and as for snow , it is entirely based on a few stems that actually mean " ice " , and on many stems that do not fundamentally mean " ice " . so , at least in some eskimo languages , such as cnetral siberian yupik eskimo , there are actually more expressions ( or if you want " words " ) for " ice " than for " snow " . for the definition of a " word " and " stem " in eskimo , i refer y ' all back to woodbury 's statement . the point is that technical terminology for things that interest eskimos is no different from technical terminology that is relevant to , say , swiss cuckoo clock makers . willem j . de reuse dept . of anthropology university of arizona tucson , az 85721

Subject: eskimo snow in context

as the quotation from whorf shows , he was concerned with the issue of whether there is a general term like 's now ' in eskimo languages , not with whether eskimo ( or english ) have a multitude of specialized terms . it may be useful to point out that in the second half of the 19th century and thereafter one of the big issues concerning linguists and anthropologists was whether " primitive " people and their " primitive " languages possessed abstract terms . i think that we must view whorf 's and others ' preoccupations in this context . ( it may be of interest to add that the other great issues regarding " primitive " languages was whether they possess clearly defined sounds , since it was widely claimed that speakersof such languages " alternate " between different pronunications . it was boas who showed that this was an illusion , but i think that many people would not listen , and that works such as sapir 's paper on the sound pattenrs and even on psychological reality are largely to be understoods as attempts to defend the boas position ) . in any case , it should be clear that the issue was never how many words a language might have for specific kinds of anything , but whether it has words for the general types or kinds . and in this context the only question is whether the eskimo languages have one word for 's now ' like english or two like ancient greek or whether they only have a variety of more particular words for kinds of snow . alexis

Subject: english snow words

jonathan david bobaljik posted a message to vol . 5-1276 of this list in which he discusses the various yup ' ik words for snow that have been contributed by anthony woodbury . for the sake of comparison he has a list of 9 or 10 english words for snow and snow-like things . i thought it would be useful to find out whether each of these english words means _ primarily _ snow or whether the snow sense is derived , figurative , or otherwise secondary . i have consulted the various editions of the oxford english dictionary . my results are as follows : a . acceptable cases : 1 . snow : a good english word with a respectable pedigree . means primarily snow . 2 . sleet : also good . by the way , is there an eskimo term corresponding to this ? 3 . slush : also good . 4 . avalanche : this word seems to have referred to snow avalanches from the beginning . 5 . blizzard : the first edition of the oed says , " a modern word . . . . as applied to a 's now-squall , ' the word became general in the american newspapers during the severe winter of 1880-81 ; but according to the _ milwaukee republican _ = ff 4 march 1881 , it had been so applied in the _ northern vindicator _ ( esthersville , iowa ) between 1860 and 1870 . it was apparently in colloquial use in the west much earlier . . .

Subject: re : 5 . 1265 linguistics as " science "

in reference to the excellent review of " linguistics and the notion of science " i would like to point out one small inaccuracy . at the end of the post there is a quote from a beatles song , * fool on the hill * . while this is credited solely to john lennon , the song was actually written by paul mccartney ( paul can be seen singing the song in one of the first " rock videos " ever made in the film * magical mystery tour * ) . although lennon and mccartney throughout the beatles career-span shared songwriter credits , they stopped active collaboration ( with some exceptions such as * a day in the life * ) since about 1965 . what does this trivia have to do with linguistics ? well , the music of the beatles and the language they used , have influenced millions of people the world over . as a young boy growing up in india i fell in love with their music which helped me considerably in both learning the english language and appreciating western culture . those linguists who are interested in acculturation ( are there any on this list ? please contact me at the email addres below ) could study global influences like the prevalence of fiction novels , hollywoood movies , tv ( cnn ) , and pop music to account for the spread of the english language in other cultures . since the study of culture and language go hand in hand , linguistics necessarily is a multidisciplinary field that would have to include sociological , historical , and psychological approaches . to coin a phrase that sums it up ( with apologies to albert einstein ) : cultural studies that ignore language are lame , and linguistics that ignores culture is blind hemant desai univ of nebraska - lincoln email : hdesai @ unl . edu

Subject: re : " snow " 1 / 2

about snow . . . first , i should apologize to tony for misunderstanding his cocktail advice - - his derivation of the origins of my misunderstanding is correct . second , i think that quotations from boas / whorf are very helpful and a good reminder to those of us in this debate . third , as to the question of whether or not sleet is related to snow . i do n't agree . it is , i agree , related ( and would be defined in relation to ) water , but ( at least i and a few other students that i asked ) would n't define it as a form of snow ( ditto for freezing rain ) . fourth , i agree with tony that " counting " has to be mediated by many considerations of grammatical structure in the compared languages and spread of the form in the speech community . but , i do n't think that this wipes out the ( admittedly small , but original ) point . fifth , i ' m going to sidestep the issue over ' lexicalization ' vs . ' complex construction ' because i do n't think that i share the same view as others on the importance / necessity of this distinction - - indeed , it is a bit ironic that another implication of sapir / whorf is that the view that our language is made up out of ' words ' and ' grammar ' ( constructions ) is precisely the kind of objectification , which we would expect and which formal distributional analyses show to be a simplification ) . as jonathan states , " figuring out just what counts as a simple , lexicalised form is * very * hard in yup ' ik , given that it has a rich , higly productive derivational morphology " . i agree and the answer would eventually have to draw lines along continua that i do n't think will be labelled ' lexical ' vs . ' construct ' ( and sapir offered some nice theoretical machinery for these kinds of comparative distinctions too ) . i still see only four ' arbitrary and unmotivated ' forms that deal specifically with 's now ' ( i . e . , snow , slush , blizzard , flurry ) . i ' ll leave it to others to decide whether or not various dialects of eskimo have more or less , but even if the point should fail here it still has life to it . so , i still find myself agreeing with the original insight . the point - - and not all that it has been used to argue - - has always seemed obvious to me . perhaps if we narrow the scope of the relevant speech community and bring it closer to home , it is easier to see . would n't we all accept the idea that _ on average _ lawyers ( vs . non-lawyers ) have more distinct forms for legal concepts than do others outside this community / culture ? ( and , of course , what we mean by distinct forms implies all of the complex relative distinctions hinted at above ) . similarly to take an example i know more about , statistically speaking arabs have more arbitrary and unmotivated forms for camels than english speakers ( even accounting for differences in the syntactico-semantic structures of the two languages ) . why does this simple - - and to be honest relatively uninteresting - - idea seem to bother people so much ? douglas j . glick department of anthropology vassar college doglick @ vassar . edu

Subject: sum : analogy to 1sg

some time ago i posted query asking for an an example of an analogical development in the inflectional system of any language , preferably an indo - european language , whereby the 2d and 3d persons singular were remade in the image of the 1st sg . the very possibility of such a development appears to have been denied in an important article by cowgill on the reflexes of ie laryngeals in greek , and it struck me as a bizarre claim , but i could not found any ready counterexamples . i would like to thank robert hoberman , lars borin , dana paramskas , george fowler , maggie winters , and max wheeler for responding . the closest to what i am looking for was identified by wayles browne : polish present tenses of the verb ' to eat ' : jem 1sg jesz 2sg je 3sg of these , only jem is inherited . the other two forms have been remade analogically , replacing what would be expected to come out as * jesi , * jes ' c ' . however , even this example is not completely compelling since it seems that the analogy here involves this verb taking the endings typical of another conjugation rather than specifically remodeling the 2sg and 3sg on the basis of the 1sg . so , was cowgill right ? can 1sg never serve as the basis for an analogical remaking of 2sg and 3sg ? ( there are examples of 2sg being ( re ) modeled on 1sg , robert hoberman pointing out that this is what happened in the perfect of ge ' ez , and i have since also found discussion of this happening in some yemeni arabic dialects , but the 3sg is not affected in any of these cases ) . alexis manaster ramer

Subject: sum : wh animal

i recently asked about whether one says ' who ' or ' what ' to ask what variety of animal in contexts such as : a . a person walks into a room with a swollen arm . you say : ' wh - bit you ? ' or b . you see an animal disappearing into the woods . you say : ' wh - is that ? ' the following languages ( thanks to the people listed for the info ) seem to use ' what ' only , although in context a gave some of the respondents did not like either alternative . greek ( a speaker who wished not to be identified by name ) finnish , swedish ( jussi karlgren ) english , hebrew ( david gil ) dutch , french ( bert peeters ) georgian ( ivan derzhanski ) german ( john peterson ) norwegian , swedish ( marit julien ) danish ( soren harder ) i would add polish to this list , based on my own judgements . ivan derzhanski adds bulgarian to the list , his testimony being particularly valuable , since he feels a clear contrast between bulgarian and russian here , but greg gouzev says that he would use ' who ' in context a ( but not b ) . on the other hand , dale russell reports that in cheyenne : " people are all animate , but so are rocks , trees and leaves ( but not branches ) and the sun . animals are all animate , so far as i know . some body parts are animate , roughly those that are voluntarily movable . noses are not animate , fingers are . if you point to a rock and ask " what is this ? " , a native speaker will correct you , and say " who is this ? " , then answer the question - - at least that was my experience , in a field-methods type language learning experience . " jonathan bobaljnik reports that itel ' men sometimes uses ' who ' and sometimes ' what ' for referring to animals . unfortunately , there 's very little data on the language , so i can't be very specific about the conditions determining which you get when . the clearest example of a language that uses ' who ' is russian ( in a striking contrast to closely related polish and bulgarian ) , as stated in standard works on this language and confirmed to me by alex eulenberg , ari solovyova , and ivan derzhanski ( but i must add that daniel radzinski reports that at least one speaker he spoke with gave different judgements ) . i find particularly interesting the fact that russian linguists working on other languages routinely note this difference between russian and whatever language they are describing ( i have seen this probably dozens of times in russian grammars or dictionaries of various languages of the former empire ) . barbara abbott noted a reference i had missed : chomsky 's in _ current issues in linguistic theory _ ( mouton , 1964 ) , p . 40 , notes that we cannot say " what is eating its dinner ? ( the cat or the dog ) " , and that ' who ' is also not natural in that context . a lot of the respondents indicated similar difficulties in other languages . i have not kept track of these , but they include french , danish , etc . , as noted by various respondents ( including frank gladney on english ) . cathy ball says that older forms of english sometimes use ' what are you ? ' in addressing a human being . special thanks to osten dahl who first pointed out to me that you have to define very particular contexts for this question , since in many contexts many lgs allow neither ' who ' nor ' what ' . alexis manaster ramer

may i add my quantum of intuitive ( non-syntactician 's , nay non-linguist 's ) data to this discussion : ) date : sun , 20 nov 1994 12 : 41 : 23 gmt + 1200 ) from : wayne lawrence ( wp . lawrence @ auckland . ac . nz ) ) subject : re : sum : native speaker intuitions ) ) marilyn silva recently summarised responses dealing with " native ) speaker intuitions " , especially with respect to the sentence ' john ) asked mary to leave ' . she notes that several respondents pointed out ) that the interpretation of this sentence is determined , at least in ) part , pragmatically , and the view that the interpretation is ) syntactically fixed is wrong . this point is demonstrated by the ) ) pair of examples : ) ) ) ) [ 1 ] the teacher asked the child to leave the room . ) ) [ 2 ] the child asked the teacher to leave the room . ) ) i am a native speaker of english ( new zealand english ) , and i am not ) a syntactician , so i do n't think my syntax is being moulded by my , or ) anyone else 's , rules or theories , but , in both [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] , i can ) only interpret the person being asked ( the child in [ 1 ] , the teacher ) in [ 2 ] ) as being the person required to leave the room . there is ( in my intuition ) an undoubted pragmatic element . in both cases , the teacher is supposed to be in authority and the child not . therefore [ 1 ] causes no hesitation and immediately evokes a normal situation : the teacher made a request to the child that the child leave the room . case [ 2 ] immediately evokes a picture that the child made a request to the teacher that the teacher leave the room . given the presupposed authority relationship , intuition says " hold on ! kids do n't do that ! " - except in special circumstances . so look for a special context ( ? classrom game ? ) or try a possible re-interpretation . for the latter , remember the form " the child asked to leave the room " ( teacher implicit ) and admit that [ 2 ] is a possible way of saying it ( teacher explicit ) . however , i have to agree with wayne lawrence that the immediate intrepretation is as his : the person being asked is expected to leave . this interpretation is a function of syntax . only when you have " had a look " at the syntactically generated interpretation do pragmatic constraints force you to re-consider . it is , i report for myself , a distinctly two-stage process , and the second is only triggered if there are problems with the result of the first . in the case , however , of " john asked mary to leave " there is nothing given corresponding to the authority relationship which would make it unlikely that john expects mary to leave , and in that case , i am afraid , syntax has it . ted .

Subject: re : original karamojong / jie language

leo connolly cross-posted a question about karamojong on linguist and sci . lang . i posted a response on sci . lang , and i ' m cross-posting it here . in article ( 1994nov22 . 145346 . 29219 @ msuvx1 . memphis . edu ) , connolly @ cc . memphis . edu writes : ) a colleague of mine would like to know the latest opinion concerning the ) original language of the " karamojong hordes " and / or jie , who have abandoned ) their original language in favor of that of the masai . does anyone know ) whether their tongue is best described as " nilotic " or " sudanic " ? or does n't ) it matter ? and if greenberg classified this language , which se seems to ave ) done , does anyone know if his classification is still generally accepted ( a ) fair question in view of his more recent amerindian debacle ) ? ) bill welmers , in his " checklist of language and dialect names " ( sebeok , t . a . , 1971 , current trends in linguistics , vol . 7 : linguistics in sub - saharan africa , the hague : mouton ) lists karamojong as a member of the chari - nile branch of nilo - saharan . in the same volume , greenberg 's article " nilo - saharan and meroitic " gives a little more detail , assigning it to the teso group of eastern nilotic , itself a branch of eastern sudanic , which is a branch of chari - nile . its cognate languages within teso are teso , toposa , and turkana . i do n't work on nilo - saharan , so i ' m not up to date on current classification . however , in african languages as a whole , greenberg 's four major families , niger - congo , nilo - saharan , afro - asiatic , and khoi - san have stood up pretty well for the last 30 years . there has been some discussion of a relationship between niger - congo and nilo - saharan , but no convincing case has yet been published . within niger - congo there has been some realignment ( john bendor - samuel , 1991 , the niger - congo languages , university press of america ) , the most significant being the shifting of the benue - congo boundary some 600 or so miles westwards to include what greenberg called eastern kwa . greenberg 's southern cushitic ( afro - asiatic ) is now referred to as omotic and its membership in afro - asiatic seems to be in some doubt . otherwise his african classification works remarkably well . as an africanist who was in graduate school towards the end of the debate on greenberg 's african classification , i see some strong parallels with the amerindian debate . the vehemence , even rancor , of his critics back in the fifties and sixties was no less than what we ' ve seen more recently . it is certainly unfortunate that there is apparently so much flawed data in his american work , something i can't judge but apparently much more than was in his african work , but at the same time his method of mass comparison is more archeological in nature than linguistic and has a remarkably high tolerance for error . i consider the jury still out . flames accepted but probably ignored . herbert stahlke , associate director email : 00hfstahlke @ bsu . edu university computing services phone : 317-285 - 1843 ball state university fax : 317-285 - 1797 muncie , in 47306

Subject: the comparative method and syntactic reconstruction

the ongoing discussion in the list about the comparative method has raised questions about its applicability to syntactic reconstruction . i have the impression that with increasing frequency , one comes across statements such as the following in the literature : " most of the attested languages in language family x have some syntactic property . therefore we can assume that proto - x had this property . " or " of all the languages in family y , only language ( a ) has some particular syntactic property . therefore we can assume that this property of ( a ) is an innovation not present in proto - y . " in other words , there is the tacit assumption that the comparative method can be applied to syntax . but can it ? could anything resembling latin syntax be reconstructed through comparison of the syntax of the modern romance languages ? most of the modern germanic languages are svo . should we therefore reconstruct proto - germanic ( almost surely incorrectly ) as svo ? standard introductions to historical linguistics ( e . g . anttila , jeffers & lehiste , etc . ) argue that the comparative method is inapplicable to syntactic reconstruction due to the fact that there is no analog in syntax to regular sound change . oversimplifying a bit , words are composed of phonemes ; the comparative method assumes that phonemic change in one word in a particular environment will be mirrored by like changes in other words in similar environments . but what are the syntactic analogues of words and phonemes ? and furthermore , syntactic change can be fairly catyclysmic , restructuring grammars wholesale in one generation - - unlikely or impossible with phonological systems . i would be interested in hearing the opinions of others on the question of syntactic reconstruction on the basis of comparing similarities and differences ; also , i wonder if there has been discussion in the literature that has led to a change in opinion from what i took to be the standard position that the comparative method is inapplicable . fritz newmeyer fjn @ u . washington . edu

Subject: " sum : have / hold / compulsion / existence

about a month ago , i posted an enquiry asking for help in finding non - ie languages , in which there was a connection between any of the following expressions : ' hold ' and ' possess ' , synchronically or diachronically ' exist ' and ' possess ' ' must / should ' and ' possess ' and i was quite happy about the enthusiastic reponse ( around 20 of you contacted me ) . so , for all who are interested , here is a short summary . i hope i have n't left anyone out and that i have n't confused anything , as i know next to nothing about the languages you all told me about . there was also the small 'd isaster ' with my email - i accidentally deleted some of your answers , so i apologize if you answered but do n't find your name in the list . i would like to take the chance now to thank all those who did answer with information on the following languages : japanese : here , the verb mot - ' hold ' can also be used to a large extent for ' possess ' , but not for ' existence ' or ' compulsion ' also , an anonymous reply pointed out another construction for ' possess ' with aru - ' exist ' , but was not sure about the difference in meaning between ' possess ' with mot - and ' possess ' with aru . basque : * edun ( nowadays - du - ) is used for possession and as an auxiliary . in addition , in the south , the verb eduki ' hold ' has also to some extent been grammaticalized to denote ' possess ' and also ' perfect ' with transitive verbs , while intransitives form the perfect with izan ' be ' . this development seems to be following the lines of the development latin ) romance . hebrew : there is no verb ' possess ' in hebrew : possession is expressed periphrastically ( with the " dative " ) . interestingly , here also there is a connection between ' possess ' and ' compulsion ' and ' existence ' , which all apparently use this construction . aramaic : in many aramaic dialects , the earlier construction ' past participle + dative ( ' l ' ) + pronoun ' became the past tense . l is now predominantly used for a goal with verbs of motion , but is also used for possession . arabic : in cairene colloquial arabic , @ anda ' at / near / by ' is used for possession and is then negated like a verb , not like a preposition . tamil iru ' be ( located ) ' + dative is used for possession and for durative / continuous aspect , but not for perfect / perfective . kol ' hold ' , although not used for ' possess ' can be combined with iru and denotes that the action is one of the following : self-benefactive , reflexive , deliberate and / or accidental ( depending on what was expected ) . crow : ' exist ' / ' not-exist ' is not only used for existence but also ' possess ' and perfective aspect . finish : pitaa ' hold ' can also be used to express ' compulsion ' but interestingly , not ' possess ' . dakota : yuha ' hold ' may also be used to some extent for ' have ' , otherwise ' be with ' is used . chinese : yong3yiu3 , where yong3 denotes ' embrace ' , can also be used to express ' possess , own ' . to stress that one has total control , one may use zhung3yiu3 , where zhung3 denotes ' hold in one 's palm ' ( yiu3 is ' possess ' , ' existence ' and can also be used for ' perfect ' with questions and negative statements ) idg * ghebh ' give ' -

Subject: sum : eng ns in - ee

more than a dozen linguist readers responded to my request for naturally occurring instances of english nouns in - ee ( as in _ employee _ , _ escapee _ , etc . ) - - thanks ! special thanks go to gregory grefenstette of rank xerox research center in grenoble , who searched half a gigabyte of recent newspaper articles . several people reported uses of _ mentee _ ` person who is mentored ' , and i had reports of _ standee _ ` person required to stand ( as on a bus ) ' from london , new york , louisiana , and british columbia . a paper draft containing a catalog of attested uses of over 400 - ee noun word types is available through anonymous ftp at : ftp : / / ling . rochester . edu / pub / barker / papers / ee files available include the draft itself , a two-page summary abstract , and most of the relevant entries from the second edition of the oed ( including quotations ) . the paper contains quite a lot of data , and requires 48 pages to print . the data suggest that formation in - ee is highly productive , that analyses based on the syntactic argument structure of the stem verb are either incomplete or severely disjunctive , and that formation of - ee nouns obeys three essentially semantic constraints : an - ee noun referent must be sentient , the denotation of an - ee noun must be episodically linked to the denotation of its stem ( i give a formal semantic event-based definition of ` ` episodically linked ' ' ) , and the referent of an - ee noun must lack volitional control over some relevant aspect of the event which qualifies it as being in the extension of the noun in question . taken together , i argue that these semantic constraints amount to a thematic role type . if so , then semantically defined thematic roles can actively guide formation of new words . an unsystematic selection of data contributed by readers of linguist : best wishee ` . . . who has one lovable father , one lovable mother , one sick somebody , one successful somebody , one good-deed - doer , one poor pen pal , one best wishee , and two birthday celebrants for every nine letters you send .

Subject: summary of ' bubbler '

a few months ago i posted an inquiry on the linguist listing on the distribution of the word " bubbler " as a synonym for drinking fountain . thanks to all who responded , which are too many to list . the dictionary of american regional english has also extensively investigated this word and it was my goal to gain more specific information than that supplied by dare ( for example , the regional distribution within wisconsin . ) here is a summary of my findings : in wisconsin , bubbler is used throughout the eastern half of the state , particularly along the coast of lake michigan and becomes less prominent the further west one travels . the " stronghold " of bubbler appears to be in milwaukee and its suburbs . milwaukee is also thought to be the geographic origin of bubbler , coined by the kohler company in the early 1900 's . my university ( uw - whitewater ) appears to be in conflict over what to call drinking fountains . in one of our residence halls there is a sign asking residents to not use the drinking fountain as a garbage disposal . the word 'd rinking ' is crossed out , and ' water ' is put in its place . then ' water ' and ' fountain ' are crossed out , and ' bubbler ' is put in their place . it goes to show you that people can be very loyal to their colloquialisms ! my research provided no evidence for the term 's use in minnesota or illinois , but i did find the word in use along the western part of michigan 's upper peninsula ( which borders wisconsin 's bubbler-using region . ) if bubbler is used anywhere else in the midwest , its existence escaped my research . in fact , i found no evidence of the word 's use within the u . s . west of the mississippi or south of the ohio river . the other region that uses the term includes the state of rhode island ( where it is used exclusively by many speakers ) , far eastern connecticut , and southeastern massachusetts - including the boston area . i had people from this region respond with amusement because they did n't know the word was used anywhere outside of their area . lastly , and much to my surprise , bubbler is used in southeastern australia - predominately in new south wales ( including sydney and canberra ) and in portions of the provinces bordering new south wales . the information on australia is only based on a few responses , but there were some , especially in sydney , who used bubbler exclusively while growing up . there were some from parts of australia who had never heard the term before , so it does appear that it is also regionally distributed in australia . there were some who distinguished bubblers from drinking fountains . some only called outside fountains , bubblers , while others vice versa . one only called non-refridgerating fountains , bubblers . drinking fountain seems to be the generic term that everyone is familiar with , whether they use it or not . other synonymns are : water fountain , water cooler , fountain , and water bubbler . for what its worth , the only accounts i had of the term ' water bubbler ' were among african americans from milwaukee ( but this only included three people . ) just plain ' fountain ' seemed to be the word of choice in northwestern wisconsin , while drinking fountain and water fountain were used pretty interchangeably everywhere else . as for its use in literature , the only printed documentation of bubbler i could find ( under the given definition ) was a 1985 milwaukee journal article which was about the word 's usage in milwaukee . i realize that some of my findings are inconsistent with dare - i believe this is because my research was not nearly as thorough as dare , and did n't take into account historical usage , only current usage . thanks again to those who responded . your avid bubbler user , sean christensen internet : seanc @ iclnet93 . iclnet . org university of wisconsin - whitewater

Subject: comparative method in syntax

fritz newmeyer asks if it is legitimate to apply the comparative method in syntax . my answer is yes , but it is more difficult . the main reason why one sees more work on historical-comparative syntax than fifty years ago is that syntax has become much more prestigious in recent decades . i do n't think that there was a shift from a once " standard " view that syntactic reconstruction is impossible . bernhard delbrueck 's historical-comparative syntax of indo - european , published a hundred years ago , clearly showed that comparative syntax is both possible and fruitful , but perhaps too difficult to attract many followers . the view that historical-comparative syntax is impossible was defended in some detail in lightfoot 's ( 1979 ) principles of diachronic syntax , but few researchers seem to have been discouraged by lightfoot 's attitude . it is true that latin syntax could hardly be reconstructed from modern romance languages , but neither could latin morphology , and even the view of latin phonology that we would get from romance is very distorted . our reconstruction of protolanguage grammar is always imperfect , but that is no reason not to attempt reconstruction . the main error on lightfoot 's side is that there is no syntactic analog to the regularity of sound change . it 's just a bit more complicated in syntax - - just like syntax is more complicated overall than phonology . basically , the analog to phonemes and words are words and sentences . true , the difference between words and sentences is that in general sentences are not stored in the lexicon . but neither are many complex words ( rendering morphological reconstruction similarly difficult , but nobody seems ever to have objected to morphological reconstruction ) , and some sentences are actually stored , e . g . proverbs and idioms , which often show syntactic archaisms . and since earlier syntax often survives in " fossilized " form in later morphology , we have another rich source of data for diachronic syntax . in addition to regularity of change , we need general principles of change for plausible reconstruction , e . g . phonological principles that predict likely changes like assimilation , lenition , segment loss , etc . in syntax , similar principles of change exist as well : spatial nouns become spatial adpositions , certain general verbs become tense and aspect markers , allative case markers become dative case markers , purposive verb forms become infinitives , etc . all these processes ( instances of grammaticalization ) are irreversible changes and provide safe guides for linguists seeking to make sense of daughter language diversity by reconstructing a proto-syntax . the massive regularities of grammaticalization are generally ignored in generative studies of syntactic change ( indeed , lightfoot argues that there are no genuine principles of diachronic syntax ) , but if one takes them into account , they help in the difficult task of reconstruction . martin haspelmath ( free university of berlin )

Subject: re : 5 . 1370 can the comparative method be applied to syntax ?

i would add to fritz newmeyer 's caveats about limitations to syntactic reconstruction these fairly obvious two : 1 . for many syntactic dimensions , the choices are so few that chance resemblances are so probable as to obscure the evidence of common ancestry . 2 . there is consideration non-arbitrariness in syntactic systems , so that , again , resemblance arises from other than common ancestry . larry gorbet lgorbet @ mail . unm . edu anthropology & linguistics depts .

Subject: comparative method

alexis manaster ramer asks about the claim that relatedness and / or subgrouping should be established only based on systematic morphological relationships of the sort likely to be observed in paradigms or declensions . i ' m familiar with this claim only in a much weaker form , that morphological comparisons are more reliable than phonological ones as a basis for establishing linguistic relationships and subgroups . on this basis , for example , robert hetzron in 1976 * proposed a rigorous internal subgrouping for the semitic languages based on affixes in the verb paradigms . hetzron 's proposal that hebrew , arabic , and aramaic constitute a central semitic group is , i believe , correct ; and it is supported by much more evidence than hetzron adduces , much of it morphological and morpho-syntactic ( e . g . , innovation of novel negative markers , etc . ) . i may be reading too much into these claims of morphological priority in establishing subgrouping , but i have always interpreted them as a reaction to the difficulty of distinguishing convergent from shared phonological development on a principled basis . that is , because it can be difficult to determine whether a particular recurrent sound change in a language group represents shared innovation rather than convergent development , it might be pragmatically safer to rely on morphological innovation . thus , in the case of the semitic languages , such changes as * p to / f / or * g to / jh / ( as in junk ) would , if treated as shared innovation , lead to subgroups that are inconsistent with those deduced by other means . on the other hand , " unusual " changes like the change of proto - semitic glottalic consonants to pharyngealized consonants are much more likely to represent shared innovation , given the typological rarity of pharyngealized consonants . with regard to fritz newmeyer 's questions about comparative syntactic reconstruction , i do n't know of any systematic published counters to jeffers ' ( and others ' ) claims that it is * in principle * impossible . however , i think that a good case can be made that this is an overly pessimistic assessment . the problem , of course , is the appropriate context : we compare phonemes in words and / or morphemes and morphemes in paradigms , but it 's not clear what the context might be for word orders . presumably discourse context plays a role . i would imagine that if all the languages in a family shared an unusual word order ( vis a vis their dominant types , whatever those might be ) in counterfactuals , we might want to attribute that order to their latest shared ancestor . pragmatically speaking , it 's a lot easier to find information about the morphological context of particular phonemes than it is to find reliable information about the larger context for sentence and construction types . nonetheless , at least inchoately ( and perhaps it is the inchoateness that jeffers objects to ) , * some * notion of syntactic reconstruction is surely behind claims that proto - indo - european was sov or proto - semitic was svo , and the like . * " two principles of genetic reconstruction " , lingua 38 : 89-104 . alice faber faber @ haskins . yale . edu

Subject: accuracy of historical reconstruction

in writing in linguist 5 . 1393 on another topic , martinha @ fub46 . zedat . fu-berlin . de ( martin haspelmath ) says : ) it is true that latin syntax could hardly be reconstructed from ) modern romance languages , but neither could latin morphology , and ) even the view of latin phonology that we would get from romance is ) very distorted . our reconstruction of protolanguage grammar is ) always imperfect . . . in looking at historical reconstruction done for s . american languages ( largely phonological ) , i ' ve often wondered about this . just how much could we trust the reconstructions that we did ? one of my rules of thumb for those languages was that if an item was longer than one syllable , it was suspect as being polymorphemic , and if it was longer than two syllables it was almost certainly polymorphemic . the problem is that most attempts at reconstruction ignored this areal phenomenon ( sometimes because the data was simply unavailable ) . from what i know of romance languages , i would say polysyllabic morphemes are more common there . if anything , that should make it easier to reconstruct latin , since you have more to work with . ( of course , the morphology of romance languages is much better known than that of the languages of s . america , which also helps ! ) so if latin would be very imperfectly reconstructed , what hope is there for native american languages ? has anyone ever attempted , as an exercise in the comparative method , reconstruction of latin from the romance languages , then compared the results with the real thing ? or reconstruction of any other attested language from its descendents ?

Subject: qs : laryngeal phonetics

dear colleagues : i have a number of questions regarding laryngeal phonetics . 1 . i understand that english voiced stops are phonetically voiceless unaspirated in initial position . ( data are cited in kingston & diehl 1994 : 432-434 . [ kingston , john , and randy l . diehl , 1994 , phonetic knowledge , _ language _ 70 : 3 . 419-454 . ] ) what is the story about pretonic intervocalic allophones after unstressed , short vowels , e . g . fidelity , legality , mobility ? to my ear they sound the same as in delegate , gallon , billion , but to my english - prejudiced ear they also sound voiced . 2 . what is the story about laryngealization or creaky voice ? i have seen this described as " a very slow vibration through only one end of the vocal cords " ( crystal , _ dictionary of linguistics _ ( ? inexact citation ) ) . what are the arytenoid cartilages doing at the posterior end of the vocal folds ? how is it related to the closure for glottal stop and for glottalized consonants ? 3 . what is going on with the articulation of " stage whispered " speech ? in whisper , the arytenoids are rotated so as to adduct the posterior ends of the vocal folds at their anterior ends , but the posterior ends of the arytenoids are not themselves adducted by the interarytenoid muscles , leaving a restricted , triangular opening at which sibilant-like turbulence is generated in place of voice . introspecting , stage whisper seems to me to be like whisper only with some turbulence as air passes the closure of the main ( anterior ) portion of the vocal folds . there seems to be somewhat higher subglottal air pressure , like a " shouted " whisper , but it does not seem to be merely a question of forcing air past the closed vocal folds . there seem to be some additional differences of articulation to produce the turbulence over the vocal folds , as evidenced at least by increased tension in observable laryngeal and ( to some extent ) pharyngeal muscles . it also seems to me that some degree of pharyngealization is an incidental byproduct . 4 . how is this related to pharyngeal spirants , as exemplified by arabic ? 5 . kingston and diehl ( 1994 : 441 ) say that " in languages such as english " ( meaning , i take it , languages without contrastive voiced aspirates ) the phonological distinction [ + / - voice ] is signaled in part by aspiration initially , but not ( if i read them right ) intervocalically . more important , it is said , is the ratio of duration of consonants to duration of vowels , or perhaps the duration of v to vc syllable rimes ( ? ) . can someone say more about this ? these questions bear on characteristics of a language i am working on . in the near term for purposes of defining the issues and refining research strategy , specific information will be more helpful to me than pointers to the literature , because my access to research library resources is not easy ( actually , it 's rather difficult ) , but i will need the pointers too and must of course eventually follow them up . all help will be greatly appreciated . please respond to me and not to the list . if there is interest i will post a summary . bruce nevin bn @ lightstream . com

Subject: re : 5 . 1404 comparative method in linguistics

karl teeter is mistaken , i think , when he says that you cannot classify languages on the basis of phonological correspondences in the lexical items , when he says that you would treat english and french as related ( via the norman borrowings ) if you did this , when he says that the idea of using this method is " novel " , when he says that you can only classify lamnguages as related if you have written a comparative grammar , etc . ( a ) for many language families , there is no other basis for classification available , because they lack the kind of morphological complexity so beloved of indo - europeanists , algonkianists , and those other - ists who happen to enjoy its blessings in " their " languages , ( b ) the danger of confusing borrowings for cognates is always real , but it is easy to see that the lexical connaections of english with french are more transparent phonologically and less central semantically than those with dutch , hence more recent , hence borrowings . ( c ) there is nothing novel in what i am saying , since it is the method which , for example , edward sapir used to establish that the uto - aztecan languages are really a family ( rather than three families ) . ( d ) you cannot possibly realistically expect normal people to spend time writing comparative grammars of languages which have not previously been shown to be related . so classification must come first ! on the other hand , it is perfectly easy to write a " crazy " comparative grammar for any random group of languages , e . g . , french and english . the last is perhaps the most important point : reconstruction of morphological systems can be done well or badly , so can comparison of lexical items . both can yield correct results ; both can also produce garbage . p . s . i say ' lexical items ' deliberately , because there seem to be language families where there is no morphology at all to compare . in most cases , howveer , there are some bound morphemes , and one compares those as well ( as did sapir in the case of uto - aztecan ) . but this is a far cry from reconstructing the kind of intricate morphological patterns found in the older indo - european languages , for example , but absent from many other language families .

Subject: comparative method ( shared sound changes )

alice faber 's very sound posting brings up a very important point : indvidual sound changes , especially those which are known to be common in languages of the world , cannot be the basis of subclassification . what you need is either sets of unrelated changes ( english has diphthongized some of the same long high vowels as high german , so that eis and ice , haus and house sound rather similar , but they do not share other changes ) , or a chronology of the sound changes with respect to other changes ( e . g . , the diphthongization in english was presumably preceded by the loss of / x / or / c , / , but there is no such change in high german ) . on the other hand , we find that the northern uto - aztecan languages share the changes of intervocalic / l / - ) / n / , / n / - > velar nasal , and / c / - > / y / . any one of these would mean little , but all three together ( and the fact that the / l / - ) / n / does not feed the / n / - > / ng / change ) make it reasonably certain that these really are shared innovations , and that northern uto - aztecan is a genuine classificatory unit ( a valid node in the uto - aztecan tree , if you will ) - - something that has until recently been generally doubted .

Subject: relative pronouns for the family pet , cont 'd

in connection with the recent thread - - initiated , if memory serves , by alexis manaster - ramer - - on the cross-linguistic patterns of + / - animate pronouns referring back to higher non-human mammalia , some new data from today 's new york times ( 12 / 6 / 94 , b1 ) may be of interest . a sheepdog intercepted by suspicious customs officials at new york 's jfk airport was x-rayed and found to be carrying five pounds of cocaine surgically implanted in her abdomen before she took off from bogota . a suspect , john erik roa of paterson , n . j . , has admitted that he knew the dog was concealing the cocaine and has been charged with drug trafficking . ( no doubt he plans to ask for immunity in exchange for testifying against the dog . ) what 's anaphorically relevant about the case is the contrast between the relative pronouns ( emphasis added below ) referring back to " coke " ( as she has been nicknamed by kennedy vet port director dr . steven weinstein ) and a fellow canine mentioned in the write-up in the times : . . . fortunately for the dog , which is gray and white and about two feet high , none of the condoms had ruptured , which [ dr . weinstein ] said would have been fatal . . . . mr . roa 's brother , andre , reached at the family home in paterson last night , said that his brother had worked in a pizza parlor until about two months ago , when he moved out of the hous . he said the family had a dog of its own , a german shepherd , which he described as a " family dog who has nothing to do with drugs " . larry horn ( lhorn @ yalevm . ycc . yale . edu )

Subject: aaai fall symoposium on formalizing context

formalizing context aaai-95 fall symposium mit , cambridge , massachusetts november 10-12 , 1995 call for papers description the notion of context has played an important role in ai systems for many years . however , formal logical explication of contexts remains an area of research in which there are significant open issues . this symposium will provide a forum for discussing formalizations of contexts , approaches to resolving open issues , and application areas for context formalisms . the most ambitious goal of formalizing contexts is to make automated reasoning systems which are never permanently stuck with the concepts they use at a given time because they can always transcend the context they are in . such a capability would allow the designer of a reasoning system to include only such phenomena as are required for the system 's immediate purpose , retaining the assurance that if a broader system is required later , " lifting rules " can be devised to restate the facts from the narrow context in the broader context with qualifications added as necessary . a formal theory of context in which sentences are always considered as asserted within a context could provide a basis for such transcendence . formal theories of context are also needed to provide a representation of the context associated with a particular circumstance , e . g . the context of a conversation in which terms have particular meanings that they would n't have in the language in general . linguists and philosophers have already studied similar notions of context . an example is the situation theory that has been proposed in philosophy and applied to linguistics . however , these theories usually lie embedded in the analysis of specific linguistic constructions , so locating the exact match with ai concerns is itself a research challenge . this symposium aims to bring together researchers who have studied or applied contexts in ai or related fields . technical papers dealing with formalizations of context , the problem of generality , and use of context in common sense reasoning are especially welcome . however , survey papers which focus on contexts from other points of view , such as philosophy , linguistics , or natural language processing , or which apply contexts in other areas of ai , are also encouraged . submission information persons wishing to make presentations at the workshop should submit papers ( up to 12 pages , 12pt font ) . persons wishing only to attend the workshop should submit a 1 - 2 page research summary including a list of relevant publications . a postscript file or 8 paper copies should be sent to the program chair . limited funding will be available to support student travel . timetable april 14 , 1995 submission deadline . may 19 , 1995 submitters will be informed of decisions august 15 , 1995 final papers due september 20 , 1995 aaai will mail working notes to the participants november 10-12 , 1995 fall symposium program committee sasa buvac ( chair ) . department of computer science , stanford university , stanford ca 94305-2140 . buvac @ sail . stanford . edu richard fikes . knowledge systems laboratory , stanford university , 701 welch road , bldg . c , palo alto , ca 94304 . fikes @ ksl . stanford . edu ramanathan guha . mcc , 3500 , w . balcones center drive , austin , tx 78759 . guha @ mcc . com pat hayes . beckman institute , 405 north mathews av . , urbana , il 61801 . phayes @ cs . uiuc . edu john mccarthy . department of computer science , stanford university , stanford ca 94305-2140 . jmc @ sail . stanford . edu murray shanahan . imperial college , dept of computing , 180 queen 's gate , london sw7 2bz , england . mps @ doc . ic . ac . uk robert stalnaker . 20d-220 , department of linguistics and philosophy , m . i . t . cambridge , ma 02139 . stal @ mit . edu johan van benthem . institute for logic , language and computation , university of amsterdam , plantage muidergracht 24 , 1018 tv amsterdam , the netherlands . johan @ fwi . uva . nl ( postscript and plain text versions of this announcement are available through the symposium www page at http : / / sail . stanford . edu / buvac / 95 - context-symposium and via anonymous ftp from sail . stanford . edu in the directory / buvac / 95 - context-symposium . )

Subject: re : 5 . 1433 comparative method

i re-read newmeyer 's original posting ( date 30 nov 94 ) and noticed that it has an implicit attack on the notion of " basic word order " for comparative purposes . this flows from his earlier question on how basic word order is variously defined by various analysts , implying that it lacks precision . to the extent that i have understood the responses so far , no one has responded to this particular point , so here goes - - basically in agreement with newmeyer , but with some criticism of the assumed larger implications for comparative reconstruction of syntax . i ' ll stick to what i know about linguistic events in europe since i expect the events to be more familiar to most readers than events in other language families , so that my examples may speak to readers ' previous ideas about particular linguistic events referred to below , and , under the best circumstances , provoke further discussion . to anticipate , the notion of basic word order is too simple-minded ( simplistic ? ) for diachronic purposes . fn : " could anything resembling latin syntax be reconstructed through comparison of the syntax of the modern romance languages ? " bw : should it ? the immediate ancestor of the romance languages is not latin but proto - romance . svo ? what about the exceptions , e . g . , french j ' ai rien fait etc . are n't they hints to certain historical complications . also aux inversion in standard french , e . g . , sont-ils venus ? standard french aux inversion is probably of germanic origin , not found elsewhere in romance . as for reconstruction of case ( cf . latin / english ) , with possible implications for earlier word order possibilities , case inflections remain on ( third person ) object clitics in all romance languages . when we consider deviations from svo word order in romance languages , we may suspect that the notion of " basic " word order is a villain to the extent that it invites the analyst to disregard less frequent or syntactically restricted word orders . this is not safe in internal reconstruction of syntax , while the most revealing procedure may be to do internal reconstruction of syntax within a language before using the comparative method to reconstruct within groups of languages genetically related by other criteria . in fact , the last point above is what is usually done , and is probably the only proper way to proceed , given the intent of the comparative method . always reconstruct a basic vocabulary first , on the basis of sound correspondences - - to justify genetic relationship among the languages . then consider syntactic comparison . problems with this necessary procedure will emerge in following discussion , but it remains necessary unless you want to reconstruct the syntactic evolution of a geographical area rather than of a genetic family . the latter may be a useful complement to assumed genetic reconstruction , but i think it is too digressive an idea for me to pursue below . now , what about preverbal object clitics in romance ? another hint of complications to the svo concept of romance . preverbal object clitic means ov - - but i suppose " basic " means when o has a noun not a pronoun as the head . and what aout the fixing of multiple object clitic order in romance ? e . g . , case order versus person ( inherent topicality ) order . that can't be reconstructed for latin because the clitics did not arise as distinct entities until proto - romance at the earliest . can a single or preferred clitic order be reconstructed for proto - romance , e . g . , dat-acc ( invariant in spanish and , i think , rumanian , but acc-dat seems to be older in french , now remaining only for third persons , i . e . , no inherent topicality difference therefore earlier case ordering remains - - french acc-dat may reflect germanic influence as well ? ) ? or did fixed clitic orders originally arise independently in various areas of romance ? in any case , how can we avoid the comparative method in addressing the problem of the origin of object clitic order in romance ? in sum , i think that the origin / s and evolution of fixed multiple object clitic orders in romance is a legitimate issue , and that it cannot be solved without recourse to the comparative method ( among others , of course ) . therefore , the comparative method cannot be dismissed in syntactic reconstruction . fn : " should we therefore reconstruct proto - germanic ( almost surely incorrectly ) as svo ? " bw : newmeyer 's reference to proto - germanic reveals even more than romance that " basic " word order is a villainous concept for reconstruction in this case , as if " basic " word orders can be compared across related languages to reconstruct " proto-basic " word orders , such that " minor " word orders can be ignored or reconstructed as " proto-minor " word orders . one principle which emerges from our knowledge of the historical record is that word order change does n't work that way , i . e . , word orders cannot be compartmentalized as " basic " and " minor " for diachronic purposes . principle : if we want to develop tools and principles for syntactic reconstruction , we will really have to consider the functions served by the various word orders at different times , and detect changes in their functions diachronically . in other words , word order change in a language must be studied in the context of the totality of functions of all its word orders at any given time . the difference between such a study and the study of change in " basic " word order , if the latter means anything at all , is analogous to the study of phonetic change and phonemic change . if analysts argue about the notion of " basic " word order , this is analogous to arguing about different concepts of the phoneme , and not about agreed upon linguistic facts . the fallacy of reconstructing " basic " word order for proto - germanic on the basis of the " basic " word order in current germanic becomes obvious according to the above principle because of the sov word order in subordinate clauses in continental germanic . and even this is not as invariant a property of the oldest texts as it is of the later standardised languages , e . g . , before middle german and dutch . english also clues us in to inversion by its many remnants , even without historical texts which reveal more similarities to continental germanic , e . g . , v - first following a subordinate clause or adverb , still common in the av bible . including english but excluding gothic which mirrors to the extent possible the new testament greek syntax from which it was translated , the earliest texts in germanic show , as far as i know , a tendency relatively favorable to verb-final in subordinate clauses , but much variation , later eliminated in the continental standards . this leads to arguments about whether or not the sov tendency was the break-up of an earlier more general indo - european sov tendency ( or earlier fixation ? ) which died in english and scandinavian ( including the still highly inflected icelandic - - creating problems even for simplistic functional arguments for the evolution of svo in germanic , so that the argument would have to be : it started as a reaction to the increasing unreliability of case distinction but spread for social reasons to languages that did n't need it . such an argument does not strike me as at all unreasonable ! ) . [ although i excluded gothic above , because of its malleable accommodation to greek syntax , its deviations from nt greek are quite revealing . most salient is the absence of a definite article , despite its occurrence in nt greek as well as in all other germanic languages . if gothic translation was totally serious about imitating nt greek syntax in all cases it could have adopted an unstressed demonstrative to imitate the greek article , as later germanic did ( in a sense ) . the most important question about gothic syntax is : is the malleability of its syntax innovative from proto - germanic ? - - if so , we will probably never know in what ways the gothic translations of nt greek stretched the limits of that malleability , and distorted the colloquial functions of word order in spoken gothic or more generally in the germanic of the third century . if sov was invariant in some ancestor , then why did it deteriorate in germanic ? at least as puzzling , how / why / when did germanic get aux inversion , even in yes / no questions . all indo - european languages show wh fronting for wh questions , so is there any reason to believe the proto - language did not . would i be buying what newmeyer is questioning with the preceding argument , cf . fn : " i have the impression that with increasing frequency , one comes across statements such as the following in the literature : " most of the attested languages in language family x have some syntactic property . therefore we can assume that proto - x had this property . " " bw : [ why with " increasing frequency " ? is the implication that copy-cat historical linguists are becoming less responsible than they used to be ( cf . the discussion of the spread of rumors about the number of eskimo words for snow ) , or that syntax is driving historical linguistics to pot ? ] to be safe , i guess ancillary arguments come in , like : considering how areally widespread the ie languages are , is it likely that the unanimity of wh first questions across ie is not reflective of the proto-language ? ok , so maybe wh fronting is proto - ie ( got a better explanation for the facts ? or reason to ignore them ? ) , but why aux inversion in germanic questions . and does the application of inversion to yes / no questions mean that there was a question marker in initial position ( wh question position ) with yes / no questions , as in " what / hullo , are you kidding me ? " ( such a marker " ibai " is found in gothic whenever the new testament greek original has " me : " ) . do n't get me wrong . i ' m not suggesting that an initial yes / no question-marker was a necessary condition for the inversion innovation in germanic . i ' m only observing that there was the option of such a marker , and anticipating ( if indeed it has not already been suggested ) that some analysts who are overly formal in their approaches to syntax might suppose the necessity of such a marker to motivate a mechanical generalisation of inversion from wh to yes / no questions . again , because such in - version occurs in all germanic should we not reconstruct it for proto - germanic . . qualification on all : it 's variable in gothic where it 's variable in nt greek : pronoun subjects usually do not invert with the verb , noun subjects usually do . ] a practical point is that , as far as i know , there is an issue about the differentiation of germanic into anything like the modern descendents before the 4 - 5th century . thus , if aux inversion goes back that far , does it matter if it spread from one germanic area to another or if it was part of proto - ( west ? ) germanic ? all innovations must spread before we recognise them as innovations in the language ( or dialect ) . historical linguistics does not study the evolution of the idiolect ( if such a concept as " evolution of the idiolect " is even coherent ) . finally , about typological arguments . when morphology-as - fossilized syntax and universal-typology of word order congealed in the early 1970s , some suggested that even before ie was sov it was vso . why ? because subject marking inflection follows the verb : v - s , get it ? inevitably , then , some suggested that celtic maintains the most archaic " basic " word order among the ie languages . this is another excess in diachronic application of ( whatever ) the notion of basic word order . the principal objection raised was that it is not obvious ( and even unlikely ) that only basic word orders morphologise . ( in fact , they may be least likely to morphologise . ) considering that s represents an unstressed anaphor in v - s , s might be in a minor word order position . [ and note that if basic word order means when the arguments are nominal , not pronominal , then discourse frequency is not criterial of basic , since at least most subject arguments are pronominal , if not merely inflectional . furthermore , if " basic " only counts the relative frequency of subject nominals , it is based on something which is quite rare in discourse : subject nominals ] . in any case , subject inflection following the verb stem is a widespread eurasian areal feature , extending into africa in semitic and various other branches of afro - asiatic . to some this might be taken as a clue to the correctness of nostratic and other super-family notions , to others an indication of an extremely old innovation having spread ( over millenia ? ) across families regardless of genetic relationship ( cf . the famous balkan area ) . still others might opt for coincidence . various other languages also have this feature , e . g . , kanuri in west africa and various new world languages . ( welcome to nostratic ? ) questions about the functions of position after the verb in so-called sov languages are raised by v - s inflectional order . the typological implications of this go beyond my current knowledge , although i dimly remember that various eurasian sov languages are different according to whether or what function post-verb - al position has in such languages . this is obvious , for example , in the contrast between eurasian sov languages ( with differences amongst themselves ) and the so-called sovx west african languages , where x is an adpositional phrase ( with complications about the origin of adpositional phrases in such languages which i will refrain from discussing here ) . since so many eurasian sov languages are also v - s inflectional languages , i do not know if there are sov languages which have a " minor " postverbal position for an anaphoric subject ( such that it turns up in other positions in certain constructions , so that we can demonstrate that it is not an inflection ) . maybe typology of relevant amerind languages will help solve this problem . but maybe we may also anticipate the reappearance of the party-spoiling question about the representativeness of curent language types to possible ( and former ) language types . no doubt an unwelcome ( and unhelpful ? ) thought to many . in this context it seems worth mentioning that mathematical probability arguments for various word orders , as i have seen them practiced , are not impressive , because of faults in their initial assumptions . for example , as far as i know , they invariably assume the validity of counting number of languages , regardless of the genetic relationship or areal contiguity of the languages counted . this seems unsound to me , particularly ignoring areal contiguity . for example , we find ( i think ) that the eurasian area , consisting of umpteen and umpred languages , has s . . . o word order ( ignoring the position of the verb as an independent variable ) . then in the new world we find large areas of contiguous s . . . o order , and separate areas of o . . . s order . maybe we should be calculating mathematical probability on the basis of contiguous area rather than number of languages . the surprising result might be that o . . . s is more probable than s . . . o ( where area is an independent variable , not individual language , of course . ) i ' m not sure what the implications of this might be , but one might be that o . . . s might have once been a more likely ordering strategy than it is now , and that the predominance of s . . . o across languages counted individually is largely the result of areal spread . [ if the spread of s . . . o is old enough , its predominance might even be the result of an absolute increase in the number of " languages " in the world all together . however , this is n't really relevant to my criticim of the way probability arguments have been applied to syntactic typology , only to the historical implications of adequate assumptions about language typology . in fact , i ' ll leave this discussion with the already widely accepted suggestion that strategies for information distribution in the clause , esp . in terms of old / new , are more relevant to typology than such problematic notions for cross-linguistic comparison as subject and object . similarly , for example , i think that in eurasia , agent . . . patient / theme order largely cuts across ergative and accusative languages , even though ergative languages would have patient / theme , or whatever term you want , as subject . to this extent , s . . . o cannot be universal even in eurasia , without confusing " accusative " definitions of subject and object , where subject status is consistent with case-marking , and " ergative " definitions , where case-marking is more closely tied to transitivity role than to the mushy cross-linguistic concept of subject . ] fn : " and furthermore , syntactic change can be fairly catyclysmic , restructuring grammars wholesale in one generation - - unlikely or impossible with phonological systems . " bw : i think the thrust of fn 's suggestion here is largely right , though probably vastly overstated ( on the basis of older ideas about creoles ? ) . however , questions remain in my mind about conditions under which these things happen . within monolingual areas ( or among closely related , mutually intelligible languages , ( certain types of ? ) syntactic strategies seem to have the potential to spead quite quickly , perhaps almost as quickly as new words and expressions , while comparable speed is not generally observed for phonological change ( and is probably " unlikely or impossible " , as newmeyer puts it , for both internal linguistic and social reasons - - in fact , i think " unlikely " is more accurate than " impossible " depending on the nature of the particular type of phonological change , and i have an example of possible single-generation phonological change in the current english of the african americans in new york city area , but i do not have sufficient data to make this possibility or its implications worth discussing here - - until i get to the section in labov 's new book where he discusses recent innovations in the chicago vowel system i will not be sure if he has other examples ) . however , to the extent that language-contact propels " cataclysmic " syntactic change ( in the historical record ) fn 's suggestion is not so clear . for example , english in east la ( a mexican american community ) is more immediately strikingingly different from adjacent english dialects on the phonological than on the syntactic level . and that applies to monolingual speakers of east la english as well as spanish - english bilinguals , and to various phonological segments as well as intonational contours ] . in understanding historical syntactic evolution , it is most often difficult to distinguish internal evolution from language contact ( hence the sour regard for substratal theories during the late 19th - to-mid 20th c celebration of neogrammarian achievements ) - - and then there is also jakobson 's caution that language contact might not permit evoluton that is not internally possible anyway , rather that it can only promote one possible direction of change as opposed to other possible directions which might flourish under other external circumstances . this too i consider problematic as a blanket statement , but a major consideration to keep in mind as a possible constraint on change in most reconstructive expeditions into the unknown past . enough . these are my thoughts about the problems of using the comparative method alone to reconstruct syntax . but nobody would suggest something so foolish as not enlisting all possible tools of reconstruction , including internal and typological in addition to comparative . conversely , it would be equally foolish to shun the comparative method as a reconstructive tool . in any case , the notion of basic word order is not helpful to syntactic reconstruction , if not of doubtful value as an autonomous observation about the synchronic state of any language as well . i mean it 's ok to observe that english and french are both synchronically svo ( spoken french even more than english - - not least because of the former 's preferred question formation strategies ) , but without further discussion that does not mean that their syntaxes are " basically " the same , in any insightful or interesting ( to coin an adjective ) sense . i would like readers to react to any of the points i have made above , not least of all the accuracy of the facts i have suggested for various languages , since i am not an expert in the areas of most of the facts i have presented , e . g . , current typological theory , indo - european linguistics , eurasian and new world areal syntactic characteristics . benji

Subject: comparative syntax

while i really like most of what scott delancey had to say about syntactic reconstruction usually being based on clues buried in the morphology ( or morphophonology ) , i do n't think this is always the case . there is a rather famous example involving a rule of ancient greek and one variety of old iranian ( the languages of the gatha 's , i seem to recall ) , whereby a neuter pl . subject triggers sg . agreement on a verb , a pattern which is often reconstructed for the proto-language because , as i understand it , of its apparent oddity . this reconstruction is not logically dependent , i do n't believe , on the identity of the actual morphemes marking gender , number , and person in these languages . i would think that there are many such quirks of syntax which could be the basis of a reconstruction . e . g . , polish and several other indo - european languages show traces of a pattern whereby an np referring to a group composed of males and females is grammatically neuter . i have been playing around with the idea of trying to reconstruct this as an old pattern which would be quite independent of the particular number morphemes involved ( b . t . w . , if anyone knows of any literature on this phenomenon , i would be grateful for any references and will post them in summary form ) . another example ( which is not so interesting , because we happen to know the history ) : russian does various complicated things with the case / number endings of the nouns and adjectives when combined with numerals . thus , in the nominative case , ' these adj n ' and ' two adj n ' show different adj and noun forms in russian , where in the presence of a numeral from 2 to 4 the adj has to be in what looks the gen . pl . form ( unless it is feminine , when either the gen . pl . or the gen . sg . is possible ) and the noun in what looks like the gen . sg . form ( except for one or two nouns which seem to take a special form differing in stress placement from the gen . sg . ) . closely related polish , on the other hand , does nothing special in this case ( though both languages do other weird things with numerals above 4 , which need not concern us ) . i wonder if we would not be able to conclude from such behavior that the ancestor of these languages had a distinct paucal number ( 2 - 4 being paucal ) category , which then merged with the plural in polish , but stayed distinct in russian ( with the further hypothesis that some of the paucal endings must have looked like the genitive sg . ones ) . and an even further hypothesis might be that the paucal was originally dual , since paucal is a very unusual category to have . of course , we know that this is what happened , but i wonder if we could not have reconstructed it even if had not known . so , provided the syntactic patterns are distinctive ( e . g . , weird ) enough , purely syntactic comparative reconstruction should be possible ( and i bet that we could even find some more examples of it in the literature besides the greek - iranian one cited above ) . the problem only seems impossible when we consider patterns which are quite prosaic ( and where the number of possibilities is small ) , like the so-called basic word order that has been talked about so much in this discussion . even there , i think , that if we looked at the detailed facts of word order ( not just ov , vo , and the like ) in a group of languages , we might be able to reconstruct the proto - system of word order with some degree of confidence . and even the basic order might be reconstructable enough if we have enough languages with enough diversity and ( geographical ) dispersion between them . the fact that classical latin was often verb-final , while all the romance languages are verb-middle or verb-initial , does not seem to be a very important counterexample , because ( a ) vernacular latin may well have been much more verb - middle than the literary and it is only the former that is relevant , ( b ) the romance languages do not exhibit very much diversity or dispersion . for ex . , does it not seem clear that we can reconstruct ov for proto - turkic and proto - mongolic ? and vo for proto - polynesian ?

Subject: re : 5 . 1414 native speaker intuitions

i would like to make a few comments on marilyn silva 's questions about control structures like ( 1 ) johnny asked the teacher to go to the bathroom . ( 2 ) johnny asked to go to the movies . which , at least for some native speakers , are acceptable and allow an interpretation with the matrix subject as the controller . i believe that the interpetation of these sentences is fully explainable in terms of speech act semantics ( no syntax needed here ) . first , it is clear that the person asked is a potential agent and that in the " unmarked " case the empty subject is also supposed to an agent supposed to perform some future action specified by the verb phrase on the infinitive clause . therefore , the first option is object control . in the case of ( 1 ) this preferential interpretation is overridden by other pragmatic factors , such as the relative social status of the participants ( student vs . teacher ) . it is relatively unlikely ( though not excluded ) that the student will ask the teacher to do something . therefore , it is seems reasonable to look for an alternative intepretation . in the case of ' ask ' = a reasonable antecedent of the understood subject is the the potential beneficiary of the request , i . e . the asker . the asker benefits from the potential action performed by the addressee of the request . johnny could certainly categorized as being the beneficiary of the situation " going to the bathroom " . thus it seems plausible to referentially link the empty subject of = the infinitive complement . similarly , for a sentence like ( 3 ) john asked paula to be assigned for the task . which seems to involve control switch , i . e . switch from object control to subject control . in this case the passive construction overtly signals that the empty subject cannot be an agent . therefore , it 's implausible to assume coreference between the empty subject and the matrix object . but both john and the empty subject are potential beneficiaries . well , not beneficiaries not in the sense of case grammar or theta-role theory but in the sense of speech act semantics . what seems to at work here is a principle of " role identity " , which has been worked out in some more detail in a recent article written by klaus - michael koepcke and myself in folia linguistica 27 . 57-105 . ( " a cognitive approach to obligatory control phenomena in english and german " ) . roles are not understood there in the sense of case grammar but as " pragmatic roles " . we also point out some interesting differences = between control in english and german , for example , that sentences like ( 4 ) der polizist bat , den saal zu verlassen . ( literally : the policeman asked to leave the room ) can only be interpeted as involving an " implicit controller " , i . e . an addresse or a set of addressees , which is not lexicalized . related issues are also discussed in my recent book " kontrollph = e4nomene im englischen und deutschen aus semantisch-pragmatischer perspektive " published by gunter narr verlag , tuebingen . by the way , koepcke and i found that native speaker 's intuitions in these matters are really very unreliable and that linguists should think of more serious ways of testing what is possible in a language and what is not . klaus panther , university of hamburg , germany

in agreement with some of the comments posted about " of " in " coulda " ( and let 's include hadda ) etc . , it is interesting to me that so many readers knowledgeable about linguistics see any more than a graphic convention attempting to represent the homophony of ' ve with " of " here . it leads to interesting questions about how spelling affects our " mental " lexical representations of words , as literate beings . however , it is questionable whether whatever " psychological reality " the spelling " of " in " could of " has for the literate will have any effect on the future of the language ( since that was brought up ) . i think the spelling " of " for unstressed " have " has about as much chance of making a verb of the other " of " as the spelling " we " would have of making french " oui " an english pronoun . the evolution of parentheses into phonological segments is perhaps more likely .

the ongoing discussions about the comparative method do not seem to be getting anywhere on achieving real consensus in greenberg and anti - greenberg camps on the question of what would could as valid evidence that certain language families are related at a large time depth . i wonder if it would not be a good idea to hear something - - from the defenders of wide-ranging and large-time - depth comparison , preferably - - concerning what would count as evidence against a genetic relationship ? as a concrete example , take the fact , recently cited by poser , that all the muskogean evidence in greenberg 's book has been found to be tainted by data errors ( geoffrey d . kimball , a critique of muskogean , " gulf " , and yukian material in _ language in the americas _ , ijal 58 ( 1992 ) , 447-501 ) . i can imagine how one might want to maintain that even this total collapse of the case on muskogean merely puts us back in a state of being neutral , a priori , on whether muskogean languages are related to other amerindian languages , or to nostratic for that matter . anti - greenberg amerindianists are perfectly prepared to agree that the amerind languages might have descended from a common source now lost . that 's neutrality . but suppose we move from that neutrality to the position that we will assume as a default that muskogean is amerind , and so are all the languages of south america , and indeed , that amerind is related to sino - tibetan and both to indo - european and thus nostratic and all of the above to khoisan . . . let us assume for the sake of argument that the world 's languages are all genetically related ; but let us take this to be an empirical assumption - - not just a willingness to reject the closet racism that poser says ruhlen once alleged in his critics , or a yearning to find universal brotherhood , but an assumption against which evidence can in principle count . now , what sort of linguistic evidence would count , for greenberg and ruhlen and illich - svitych , as disproving the inclusion of muskogean or any other family in in the conjectural ( though tentatively assumed ) proto - gaeic ? that is , what sort of data pattern or configuration of phonological and grammatical properties could suffice to make the macrocomparativists throw in the towel and go outside to meet the press and concede defeat ? there ought to be some imaginable scenario that would end up with ruhlen telling a group of reporters from the stanford daily and american scientist and other supermarket tabloids , " well , we thought we could sustain the whole proto - gaeic thing , but that set of paradigms on haida has us beat ; we ' ve had to concede the haida case ; according to our tests , haida is unrelated to the other human languages . " ( much scope for new press attention here : " haida indians are aliens from space , top expert admits . " ) but what sort of scenario would it have to be , to get the greenberg camp to admit that it was in grave trouble on some relatedness claim ? to be fair , orthodox comparativists might well say that if you put it like this , no answer should be expected . one can argue that a certain methodology applied to a certain set of data yield no evidence for relatedness between burushaski and bushman , but not that it refutes such a relatedness . a positivist view of historical linguistics would see it as maintaining hypotheses about verifiable relatednesses in a very particular form : when i say that german " pfennig " comes from an earlier germanic form with initial " p " that will be seen in languages like english with no history of a high german sound shift , i am counted as having been supported by the observation that english speakers say " penny " ; if the form turned out to be " twenny " i would be in trouble ; given german " pfund " i am committed to something like " pund " in english , and ( given the great english vowel shift ) the discovery of " pound " is more good news for me ; and so on . the predictions i am making are about an indefinitely extensible set of pairs ( ger : pfxxx , eng : pxxx ) . now , the falsity of one of these could conceivably taken to refute brittle forms of the hypothesis that english cognates of german pf-words always begin with p - , but it is n't nearly enough to be counterevidence to the whole english / german relatedness claim , of course . that claim would not be given up unless there was a complete collapse of all the evidence : if " pound " was established textually to have been a coinage by a novelist who had never heard german , if " penny " was shown to be borrowed from italian " penne " during a period when pasta had been used for small change , and then all the other sound correspondences started collapsing as well . i ' m asking this : if the 100 % collapse of greenberg 's muskogean evidence , as alleged by kimball , does not count as a complete collapse of the case that muskogean is included in amerind ( hence , a fortiori , of the case that it is in proto - gaeic ) , then i think i need some help in understanding what could be evidence against that inclusion . there had better be something . + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - + | g e o f f r e y k . p u l l u m * pullum @ cats . ucsc . edu | | stevenson college , university of california , santa cruz , california 95064 | | ( 408 ) 459-4705 * messages ( 408 ) 459-2555 / 2905 * fax ( 408 ) 459-3334 | + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +

Subject: comparative method

in response to poser , nichols does on p . 6 of her book claim that there is no way for the comparative method to distinguish between nostratic and " a much larger grouping of most lineages of the old world and new world " , that is , as she herself says , between hypothetical groupings of around c . 12000 and c . 40000 years ago , and she does say that this " because the cut-off point is so shallow " , the cut-off point being the ceiling of 6000-10000 years which she imposes ( wihout any basis , as noted in my earlier messages ) on the comparative method . since this amounts to a rejection of the nostratic hypothesis ( not as false perhaps but as unverifiable / unfalsifiable , i guess ) , this means that i am right and poser is wrong about whether there have been people who have rejected particular theories of linguistic relationship on the basis of this mythical ceiling idea . in response to teeter : i think ( and i hope karl will endorse this ) that our disagreements are really quite minor , but they are real as far as they go . for example , while karl is obviously 100 % right about meillet 's position in the scientia article ( where meillet says that lexical comparisons can never prove a relationship , and only morphological ones can ) , in his 1925 book meillet repeatedly states that you can establish a linguistic relationship purely on the basis of lexical correspondences , makes the same point that i have been making over and over again here on linguist that for some language families this is the only way of showing relationship since they lack morphology , and even makes the same point that i did about how certain things can only be done once you have established , at least tentatively , that the languages you are dealing with are related . as a matter of fact , he even shows how you could demonstrate the relatedness of the romance languages purely on the basis of a lexical comparison , using the numerals 1-10 , and then shows how you could do that for the older indo - european languages too ( although there he begins to slip in a little morphology ) . i would also like to add that i think it is a serious mistake to pretend that there are no models for comparative linguistics besides indo - european , because it is so utterly atypical of the language families of the world . there are plenty of equally well established families , several of which are older in the only sense that matters , that is , not in years before the present but in years before the earliest written records and many of which are more useful models for those working on families not yet established ( afroasiatic , austronesian , austroasiatic , uto - aztecan , altaic , etc . ) . which is not to say that there is anything wrong with knowing as much as possible about ie , but rather that there is much wrong with knowing naught but indo - european . i am not sure but i think that this is what eric hamp had in mind in a recent paper in the davis / iverson volume when he complained about how the teaching of historical linguistics is hampered by textbooks which largely draw their material from ie ( or indeed from some favored parts of it , such as romance ) . and i am happy to have sally thomason point out that morphological elements can be borrowed . meillet we must remember was greatly troubled by the possibility of such a thing and of the existence of mixed languages . he tried to debunk every examples around , and thought ( wrongly i think ) that if such languages exist , then they cannot be handled by the comparative method . the fact that such languages do exist ( e . g . , mitchif ) and yet pose no problem ( so that we have no trouble tracing certain parts of mitchif to french and others to cree ) means that meillet was worried for naught . but it also means that language classification on the basis of morphology is no more infallibible than that on the basis oif lexical material . you work with what you have available , which in some cases may be largely morphology and only a few obvious lexical parallels ( that 's how afro - asiatic was first established ) , morphology and lexicon ( indo - european ) , lexicon and a single morphological parallel ( algic , as victor golla reminded me just the other day ) , lexicon only ( vietnames and the rest of mon - khmer ) , and so on and so forth .

Subject: typology of historical change

typology of historical change this note tries to make explicit what i take for granted , and have discussed with others on occasion , but which perhaps needs a more explicit statement . one of the most fruitful avenues of research in distant language comparison , i believe , is the growth of the field i call typology of historical change . under this rubric i include for example the work of johanna nichols ( whether or not i agree with any data , findings or particulars of method , is not relevant to my point ; i still think it helps our thinking along ) . i also include , and this is a challenge i want to issue , the * * * mode of discourse * * * in which mr . vovin asked recently for help in finding typological parallels to a hypothesis he was interested in that a phrase meaning " water falls " could fossilize ( ? ) into a basic word for " rain " . in response to his query , he got back some positive answers , examples which people claimed fit this description . as a method of reasoning , this is what we need more of . that is , more accumulations of attested examples of particular changes , to educate our intuitions of what we naively think are " possible " semantic shifts by ever more experience with what actual semantic shifts are known or suspected . it will help us to improve our methods of guestimating possible language relationships , because it will at least say that a given hypothesized semantic shift is frequently attested , so it is not straining to compare lexical items whose meanings differ in such and such a way . whereas by contrast another hypothesized semantic shift is not firmly attested . so such an unattested semantic shift should probably not be used in those distant language comparisons which are themselves the most difficult to do , because over large time spans the number of context-sensitive conditioning environments is as great as the number of lexical items available to compare , and thus there are few or no * * * recurring * * * sound correspondences . in other words , as we move towards deeper comparisons , we must more and more rely on ways of measuring " distance " of semantic shift and " distance " of phonological change , rather than measuring repeating sound correspondences and semantic identities . we do not yet have our tools for doing this very well sharpened , but we can proceed gradually to sharpen them . a study of the known attested cases is the best start . in other words , if someone really wants to see how our methods fare with gradually more distant language comparisons , and to see how some new methods may fare , they should tabulate , for all known language relationships , ( a ) the proportion of sound-correspondence repetition in the comparable vocabulary ( and what " comparable " means is itself a variable , not exclusively defined by ( b ) and ( c ) ) ( b ) the " semantic distance " along attested paths of semantic change of lexical items being compared . where multiple such shifts have been attested , the estimated " distance " counts as closer , smaller . where few such shifts have been attested , the estimated " distance " counts as greater . we of course do not have enough such information in database form to use at present , but whatever we do have can be used provisionally , as explained in ( d ) ( c ) the " phonetic distance " along attested paths of phonetic change of lexical items being compared . there is relatively more of this knowledge available than for phonological change . ( d ) exploring how the three measures above vary as we go to greater time depths . that is , using first the more assured cases , then the less assured ones , how does a weighted average of " closeness " of compared lexical items vary as we go to increasing time depths ? how does the proportion of regular and often recurring sound correspondences to unique or rarely recurring sound correspondences vary as we go to increasing time depths ? it is the development of the tools in ( b , c ) which will most advance our abilities to compare at greater time depths , improve our methods . i will be very grateful to anyone who points me to studies which approximate to parts of the program outlined just above . " the comparative method " currently does not have the benefit of fully developed tools of this kind . to that degree , the current comparative methods can be considered less rigorous than they ought to be , and for that reason not as powerful at distant language comparisons as they will sometime come to be . a future comparative method can use these tools more and more precisely . the real challenge today to existing comparativists is to avoid artificially fossilizing the term " the comparative method " , to avoid treating its methods as fixed and not subject to improvement and supplementing with newer and more powerful methods , as are the methods in any other science . it would be healthy if the word " the " were dropped from the term and it were made a mass or plural term " comparative methods " . that implies no lessening of rigor . indeed , as i have been at pains to point out above , i firmly believe some of the limitations of the present state of comparative methods result from a * * * lack of rigor * * * in the area of the typology of possible changes ( phonetic , semantic , grammatical ) . work discussed by bill croft in the topic of syntactic reconstruction and typology is certainly relevant to the concerns raised here . i think we are seeing the beginnings of a new paradigm in the focus on paths of change in language , and comparative-historical linguists will be left behind if they do not add these techniques to their box of tools ( while keeping all the good techniques they already have ) . lloyd anderson

syntax wesley hudson . pragmatic constraints on binding into noun phrases . ph . d . diss . u . s . c . distr . by gsil publications ( gsil @ usc . edu ) this study analyzes a set of constructions referred to as specificity effects , where the possibility of extracting from within or binding into a noun phrase depends on non-syntactic properties of the np . in contrast to a number of syntactic studies of this phenomenon ( fiengo and higginbotham ( 1981 ) , bower ( 1987 ) , diesing ( 1990 ) ) , this work argues for a non-syntactic analysis of specificity effects . thus the inability to quantify into specific nps follows from a pragmatic equivalent to structurally determined wide scope readings . the class of nps which induce such wide scope readings is defined in terms of two distinct pragmatic properties . the first is referentiality as defined in burge ( 1974 ) , where the interpretations of referential nps are relativized to acts of reference performed on particular occasion of utterance . the second property is based on hawkins ( 1991 ) 's approach to anaphora with ( in ) definite nps ' and involves the implicatures speakers utilize in conveying whether or not a referent is identifiable . these pragmatic properties are shown to correlate with the opacity of nps more closely than syntactic or semantic properties . gsil pulbications patricia schneider - zioga . the syntax of clitic doubling in modern greek . 1994 in this dissertation it is argued that clitic doubling involves a predication structure where a clitic left dislocated ( cllded ) expression , which is a copy of the clitic doubled expression , is the subject of the predication and the clitic and doubled expression serve as the predicate variable ( cf . iatridou ( 1991 ) for clld ) : ( a ) noun phrasej [ predicate . . . cliticj - v noun phrasej . . . ] either the cllded or the doubled argument may phonetically delete . the difference between clitic doubling and clld is a matter of whether the topic or the doubled expression is phonetically ( but not syntactically ) deleted . this proposal accounts for what kind of lexical projections allow clitic - doubling ; the difference in behavior between accusative and oblique clitic doubled expressions ; the impossibility of doubling qps that contain expressions needing antecedents and other reconstruction effects ; as well as the scope interpretation of doubled qps . assymetries between clitic doubling and clld are also addressed . for more information , please contact : gsil @ usc . edu liliane haegeman , the syntax of sentential negation . 1993 / 94 ca . 250pp . paperbound approx . usd 50 rosenberg & sellier via andrea doria 14 , i-10123 torino ( credit card accepted ) this collection comprises papers by : l . haegeman , n . duffield , i . laka , j . ouhalla , e . pearce , l . progovac , g . puskas , m - l . rivero and r . zanuttini . it appears in two successive issues of " rivista di linguistica " : 5 , 2 ( 1993 ) and 6 , 1 ( 1994 ) ; the second one will be available very soon . an obvious alternative to the separate purchase of these issues is the subscription to the journal . | | | | - - - - pier marco bertinetto scuola normale superiore / / / / / / / - - - - - - - / / / / / / / - - - - - - - tel . + + 39 / ( 0 ) 50 / 509111 p . za dei cavalieri 7 / / / / / / / - - - - - - - fax : + + 39 / ( 0 ) 50 / 563513 i-56126 pisa / / / / / / / - - - - - - - / / / / / / / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - history of ling murray , stephen o .

Subject: comparative method

these are notes after the recent discussions of karl teeter , amramer , sally thomason , after the aaa meetings sessions on distant language reconstructions , and also in response to part of mr . poser 's message of 14 december . first , most of the discussion of karl teeter i can agree with wholeheartedly except in the use of any of his criteria as absolutes . even grammatical things can be borrowed ( as sally pointed out ) . people do in practice * * * correctly * * * accept a language family such as uto - aztecan as essentially proven , even when no grammar has been written for the proto-language , or when only parts of a grammar are written . on the one hand , nobody would be disturbed much if it turned out that one of the assumed uto - aztecan languages was originally from another family , with truly massive borrowing from uto - aztecan . the overall hypothesis of a uto - aztecan family would not be shaken . on the other hand , asking the question how much of the grammar of the proto-language has to be written reveals the non-absoluteness of the criterion . only a tiny bit ? that might be subject to one of the special cases in which some morphology and other grammar were borrowed ( sally 's general type of example ) . so , again , karl is right in general , but wrong if any single criterion is taken as an absolute ( unless circularly many criteria are combined by feats of legalese into a single criterion ) . i would like to modify amramer 's statement in exactly the same spirit : ) we cannot demand a detailed morphological reconstruction ) until the languages are accepted as related . this is too strong . it is not quite the same as ramer 's ) but surely he does not mean that a comparative grammar is a ) prerequisite to a reconstruction ; it is part of a reconstruction . in practice , an extensive comparative grammar is indeed written as part of a reconstruction ( ramer 's second wording above , not his first above ) , but it is not likely to be written unless * * * both * * * of the following two conditions are fulfilled : 1 ) the languages are in fact related ( makes the grammar easier to write ) 2 ) enough scholars believe that the languages might be related and so put effort into establishing their links . it is some unwarranted discouragement of the second which needs to be dealt with in our field . ramer is right that some linguists do discourage attempts to prove what has not already been proven . no risk-taking , in other words . good researchers , attempting to write a grammar of altaic for example , will report all of their results , both for genetic relatedness , for borrowing , and for a host of other questions they will not even have thought of when they started their research . some researchers evaluate only the hypothesis they started with . very often the differences of viewpoint amount to nothing more than an elevation of what one does oneself into the " true " or " real " work of the field , instead of recognizing that it takes a number of different contributions . i will illustrate from karl teeter 's recent messages , with no malice intended , because i am absolutely sure he intends none himself . in modifying his wording to take account of amramer 's point that of course people do properly classify languages on the basis of phonological correspondences , teeter writes on 10 december : " since it is clear that everybody 's first approximation to linguistic history begins with such classification . what i say is just that you cannot reconstruct languages on this basis . " ( please note the words " first approximation " in this . that you cannot reconstruct languages on the bases of classification alone seems to me a tautology . ) later in the same message , teeter reverts to the more absolute statement : " on the contrary , my contention ( not my invention ) , is that the only way to establish that languages are related is to write a grammar of the proto - langauge and show how it developed into different later grammars . " ( please note the words " the only way " and " establish " . using these words does not change the fact that uto - aztecan is * * * correctly * * * accepted as a proven family without teeter 's criteria being satisfied . ) on 8 december , teeter wrote : ) " systematic correspondences of sounds in the vocabularies " may prove ) a connection between languages , which is certainly an interesting ) first step , but there the real work of comparative grammar starts : [ then teeter mentions four possible explanations , only one genetic ] ) until one can exclude the first three factors , one has proven ) nothing at all regarding genetic relationship . teeter discounts the enormous work of discovering likely language families in the first place , trivializes that as not the " real work " and establishment of systematic sound correspondences as proving " nothing at all " regarding genetic relationship . on the contrary , that does prove a grouping as a legitimate candidate for genetic relationship , and often the nature of the sound correspondences found will also have made one or more of the alternatives less probable . the work of comparative-historical grammarians is " real work " . so is the work of those who spend enormous hard-working hours sifting potential cognates to discover potential sound correspondences . do teeter and others really have no knowledge of how much work that takes ? at no stage is something ever completely proven in an absolute sense ( not even after a comparative grammar is written , because of the potential for undiscovered problems of the kind noted by sally thomas ) . all stages of the process contribute to the end result . all stages are equally " the real work " . proof is always incremental , not nothing , not complete and absolute . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i turn next to mr . poser 's message , and to other information gleaned at the aaa meetings . perhaps mr . poser will be surprised that i am enthusiastically in favor of anyone correcting any errors in any claims of language relationship or language structure , including mr . poser 's mention of kimball correcting errors in muskogean , even or especially if that means that a greenberg claim about pronouns in amerind is weakened . it is actually claims about morphology where i expect greenberg is least likely to have succeeded in contributing something . i thank mr . poser for the bibliography i can check against my lists of corrections and for this note on muskogean pronouns . i also agree with mr . poser that the criticism of errors in data does not rely on the mere authority of the critic . ( that was not my point about appeals to authority , so one of mr . poser 's paragraphs was not directly relevant . my earlier point about appeals to authority remains . ) i did not indicate ( as mr . poser 's message suggests ) that critics complained of errors when they could not back them up . what i did say was that they claimed greenberg 's errors made the method worthless , without bothering to test whether correction of the errors would actually lead to a change in his conclusions , and without promptly providing the data so others could carry out such a test . ) from conversations , i would judge some are still reluctant to face this test , the one required by a part of their claims . ( even if their claims on this point prove wrong in some degree , because the conclusions of greenberg 's method mostly remain the same even after errors of those kinds are corrected , it still will not follow that greenberg 's methods produce valid results on a regular basis . please notice how careful it is important to be with notions of proof for or against anything . ) in conversation with bob rankin at the recent aaa meetings i indicated i was glad greenberg had made the attempt at morphology , with his 3rd - person alternation between / y / and / t / as a putative relic irregularity , but i was equally likely to end up believing that he had discovered a new typological fact , a preference for these unmarked segments and recurring conditions under which they might alternate in more or less the same way , which might indicate that the same phenomenon could arise by chance repeatedly . we are always dealing simultaneously with possibilities of genetic relationship or convergent evolution . as a general warning about the danger of throwing out hypotheses too early because they are " obviously " cases of chance lookalikes or convergent evolution , an article " common pathways of illumination " by stephen jay gould of harvard , in natural history magazine , december 1994 pp . 10-20 , discusses the origins of eyes in different phyla of the animal kingdom . he states that this had been a classic case in biology , used to show convergent evolution of originally unrelated organs to serve the same function . however , the dna specialists have gotten their hands on this one , and apparently it is * * * the same dna * * * which is regulating important parts of the production of eyes in these various phyla , barring of course a few changes in a few amino acid codes . this dna is therefore genetically inherited ( and we are talking as far back as the common node on the family tree of drosophila fruit flies , squids , and humans ! ) . if this line of argument holds up , we have quite a revolution in thinking on our hands . ( such thinking can of course go far overboard too . ) " chance lookalikes " certainly do exist massively . sound symbolism is a typological basis for their recurrence . the too-easy use of " chance lookalikes " to reject comparisons can however also be just like the too-easy use of " substrate " and many other ways of purporting to explain phenomena , but in reality merely naming them without doing the hard work of really explaining them . as another factual contribution to the discussion of greenberg 's errors , bob rankin clarified for me at the aaa meetings that he had looked at greenberg 's original notebooks , and that apparently what happened is that greenberg had a single flexible flap in his notebook bearing the language names , and sheets which he matched up against that to enter data for particular lexical items . this is a mechanism subject to errors of the two pieces of paper slipping vertically relative to each other , and in fact there were rather a large number of such errors . it was errors of rows rather than of columns ( as i loosely had assumed without ever bothering to ask if rows or columns ) . mr . poser originally asked on 9th november whether " limitations [ of the comparative method ] had been and were being used to justify resistance to proposals of emote relationships . . . " please take careful note of this wording , as mr . poser changed the wording in his message of 14 december , when he asserts no example has been given . i gave mr . poser an eyewitness account satisfying the wording he used . i stand by that eyewitness account . ( i do not like naming names ever in these matters , but mr . poser 's assertion could be answered only by an eyewitness account . ) none of mr . poser 's supposed rebuttal in his recent message is at all relevant to that claim , though it is relevant to another claim , an absurd one , that i did not make . ( as in his previous message , mr . poser mixes several different wordings of what are quite radically different hypotheses . any extended discussion of these variants would not be relevant to any of our central points , so i omit them . ) to be specific about that absurd claim i did * not * make , i quite agree with mr . poser that some of the same people also criticize greenberg 's hypotheses based on the factual data . i have never denied that , and in fact took pains to refer to other good work by the same people , and have always emphasized the importance of having corrections of data . mr . poser 's conclusion was : ) it thus appears , as i thought , that there are no real examples of perceived ) limitations of the comparative method being used as the basis for rejecting ) proposals of genetic affiliation . since i gave an eyewitness account of such an example of the perceived limitations being used as one basis for rejecting proposals of genetic affiliation , mr . poser can only maintain his original assertion by converting it into a different assertion as he has here , namely that there is no case of a person using those perceived limitations as " the " ( read " the only " ) basis for rejecting such proposals . i will simply repeat that in the case to which i was eyewitness , the tone of the presentation was quite clear that the absurdity of the time depth was sufficient * * * in and of itself * * * to rule out the legitimacy of attempting such distant comparison . ( a critique of errors in greenberg 's data is not directly relevant to this point , even if engaged in by the same person . ) apparently mr . poser wants his allies to be persons who not only do good work , but also do nothing wrong . but we cannot posit such a division between the " holy " and the " unclean " , like the caste distinctions of traditional india . no one has the right to take such a position vis a vis other good-faith researchers , however much they may disagree with data , results , or methods . i gather from some conversations at the aaa that some of the people involved have become more moderate since the earlier years in these matters , at least in their public statements . that is certainly all to the good . there are also small beginnings of developments of method which may turn out to be relevant to our current limitations . i am perplexed by mr . poser 's discussion of the supposed rule of using only three-consonant matches never merely two-consonant matches . although i used siouxan - yuchi , because some amerindianists are considering this , the point does not depend in the slightest on whether one believes these two particular nodes are related or not . perhaps someone can propose another alternative ( i would suggest looking for one in tibeto - burman , where perhaps only one consonant , one vowel , and tone would be available , and yet the genetic relations are in some cases secure . ) i agree with mr . poser that it is better to have three consonants than two , and precisely because it helps to avoid chance resemblances . as i stated in the previous message . that means that the only difference between us is that mr . poser will consider treating the preferred method ( 3 consonants ) as the only permitted one : ) if ( probably contrary to fact ) , matches of three consonants are ) necessary to exclude chance , . . . i do not see why we should be ) unwilling , in that case , to conclude either that they are not ) related or that , if they are , the relationship is not demonstrable . the problem here is the notion that such a particular rule * could even conceivably * be " necessary to exclude chance " . no rule is necessary to exclude chance . a large number of procedures and methods can * * * help * * * to exclude chance . except in the most difficult cases of all , probably most single rules can be violated , and there will still be enough other ways of excluding chance that a good result can be achieved . it is this fossilization in the response to expansions of the methods available as part of " the comparative method " which is damaging to increasing the rigor as well as the power of our field . it is encouraging to see sessions on distant language relationships . i firmly believe some of these sessions would not be occurring nor would there be so much work on studying methods , if greenberg had not published that book . some of the growth of interdisciplinary cooperation and communication was also in the process of happening anyway , and greenberg just accidentally published at this time . ( i am not trying to credit him with causing all of this interest . ) i particularly liked john colarusso 's contribution to the eurasian session , because he outlined his views on why distant language comparisons are very difficult because of the progressive loss of data , yet he is not in the business of criticizing people who attempt these . he is in the business of himself contributing to a deepening of both linguistic and mythological comparisons as much as he can in areas which are still to a great extent uncharted . johanna nichols also provoked much thought with her methods , and ways of integrating more information on peripheries vs . centers of innovation and residue of repeated waves of innovation visible even at the peripheries , as a pattern to look for in projecting a homeland backwards in time . i am somewhat skeptical about very distant language comparisons which involve only identities of sound correspondence , precisely because it is so easy for this approach to select a very old but still relatively more recent layer of borrowings ( more recent than the node on the family tree we may be struggling to find a way to reach ) . as greenberg pointed out , an increase in the number of conditioning contexts over time , once it approaches the number of lexical items available for comparison , leads to the result that there are virtually no recurrences of exactly the same sound correspondences . please see a separate message on how we can sharpen our tools to deal with this , titled " typology of historical change " . this means that i start out somewhat skeptical about alan bomhard 's nostratic and similar comparisons , precisely because he uses only or preferentially sound correspondences of identity . but that may be my personal bias , and i may end up granting that such a strictness of sound correspondences can actually work over great time depths . i cannot presume to know . there was one session i did not attend but report here from the abstract , in which researchers reported results of mitochondrial dna studies of the various native american populations . as expected , eskimo and athabaskan were separable ( one variety each ? ) . the remainder of native american populations shared four varieties of mitochondrial dna , either without subgrouping , or perhaps in two major subgroups . bob rankin did attend and says that the authors in their presentation had come down on the side of two major subgroups . population genetics need not match language directly , but the data is still at least interesting and obliquely relevant . . . lloyd anderson

Subject: re : 5 . 1470 open letter to _ language _

many readers of linguist ( and of language ) are , as the open letter indicates , interested in methodological issues that come up in efforts to establish very distant linguistic relationships like nostratic . although it 's true that language has published no review of illich - svitych 's books - - the scholar who agreed to review them has not yet submitted the promised review - - research in the same tradition has been reviewed in the journal : see bernard comrie 's review of starostin 's book on altaic and japanese in language 69 : 828-832 ( 1993 ) . the methodological issues involved in the altaic & japanese case are the same as the issues involved in the nostratic case , so i ' m puzzled by the open-letter signers ' apparent belief that the russian approach to these issues has received no attention in language . sarah thomason editor , language

Subject: ijcai95 workshop on context in nlp

call for papers ijcai-95 workshop on context in natural language processing august 19 , 20 , or 21 , 1995 montreal , canada correct interpretation of natural language utterances and texts requires linguistic and non-linguistic context . the goal of this workshop is to investigate the nature of context in natural language , its role in natural language processing , and shed some light on this largely unexplored area of great theoretical and practical importance . dialogue and text processing are two application domains where the lack of good theories of context impedes significant progress in applying and developing new technologies . as speech technology matures , it becomes technically feasible to build dialogue systems . however , understanding dialogues , and especially multimodal dialogues , is not possible without some account of the role of context . similarly , with today 's text processing technology it is feasible to automatically create knowledge bases from fairly unconstrained texts such as newspaper archives . ignoring context in such texts , however , results in knowledge bases that are not only very incomplete , but also dramatically different from knowledge bases created by humans , based on the same texts . we invite papers from researchers active in the fields of natural language processing , knowledge representation , and other related areas addressing theoretical aspects of context and their implications for designing practical nlp systems . we are interested in reports on implemented nlp systems utilizing contextual information . we are also interested in knowledge representation systems , inference methods , and algorithms that would allow one to computationally handle specific aspects of context . agenda : our workshop will provide answers and insights into how to go about answering a number of questions , including the following : i : role of context in natural language what is context ? what is " context of the previous utterance / sentence " " context of the dialog-so - far / text-so - far " and what is the relationship between them ? how many different contexts are there ? what makes two contexts different ? what is the relationship between formalization of context and natural language ideas of context ? what is the status of context in a formal representation aiming at truthfully capturing all the characteristics of natural language ? is context an inherent characteristic of natural language that ultimately decides the formal power of natural language ? is natural language minus context a less powerful formal language ? does representing context and truthfully capturing characteristics of natural language require new knowledge representation or automated reasoning systems ? what is the relationship between context , and the semantics and pragmatics of natural language ? is context different from possible worlds and situations ? what is the relationship between domain ontologies and contexts ? ii : context-dependent interpretation of natural language in which way does context affect interpretation of natural language utterances and texts ? which aspects of context or which contexts result in refined , more general , and different interpretations of natural language ? which aspects of context are explicit and which are implicit in natural language utterances and texts ? which phenomena and inferences observed in natural language are context-independent and which ones always depend on context ? iii : computability does handling context increase or decrease computational complexity of natural language processing ? how to automatically identify context-provided constraints resulting in conveying and understanding additional or different aspects of information ? how to represent those extra constraints provided by context and how to automatically compute context-dependent interpretation of natural language ? should the final interpretation of natural language be decontextualized when stored in a knowledge base ? how can information obtained in one context be utilized in another , possibly unanticipated context ? workshop format : we will hold four sessions : i : role of context in natural language ii : context - dependent interpretation of natural language iii : computability iv : general discussion sessions i , ii , and iii will be mildly structured : first , the committee will present a brief overview of possible answers to the specific questions included in the agenda , and discuss their own answers . this presentation will be mixed with questions from the participants . second , the participants whose papers were accepted will briefly comment on their own answers to these questions . these presentations will also be mixed with questions from the participants . session iv , a general discussion , will give each participant a chance to make a statement about any context-related issue , make a comment , raise a question , argue for or against some answers etc . pre-worshop activities : a pre-workshop mailing list will be established ; please , indicate whether you want to be included ; in order to facilitate interaction and focus the discussion , two months before the workshop , we will provide all the participants with specific examples and data illustrating various aspects of context . authors + titles + abstracts of the accepted papers , but not the papers themselves , will be available on-line to everybody . the papers will only be available to the workshop participants . we hope that this will encourage people to make strong claims even if the support for them is not quite there , report on partial , ongoing , promising research , be frank in evaluating existing approaches and their own accomplishments , openly comment on limitations , in short , say all those ( very ) informative things that are sometimes difficult , if not impossible , to communicate in " official " publications . shared data , references , papers and the mailing list are to allow the participants to : - sort out as many as possible things before the workshop - help focusing the workshop discussion on the hardest and most controversial issues - raise objections and bring up controversial claims early on in order to prepare well thought of answers and constructive critique participants : a limited number , 30 or so , active participants will be selected on the basis of submitted papers . a small number , 5 or so , of no-paper -

Subject: comparative method

just as morris halle once pointed out that any phonological system could be analyzed as having two phonemes , so too it seems clear that any two languages , related or not , could have a reconstruction done for them , involving both a set of correspondences among the words or morphemes and a comparative grammar . and just as in fact a phonology with only two phonemes would be just a formal excersise and not a real phonology , so too the " reconstruction " i am referring to would have no validity unless the languages really are related ( or in the case of mixed languages , unless the relevant parts were related ) . but the formal possibility is important to the following extent : it shows that we cannot assume that the ability to write a comparative grammar is either necessary or sufficient for showing that the languages in question are related . it is the ability to write a convincing comparative gramm ` r that is significant here , but by the same token language relatedness can be sjown by establishing a convincing set of correspodences between suitable sets of words or morphemes of the languages being compared . i will even conceded that it is harder , in general , to be convincing in the case of a comparative grammar than it is in the case of a set of correspondences ( since the former would seem to include the latter plus a lot more ) . but what no one has yet shown here or anywhere else is that the only way to establish language relatedness is by writing a complete comparative grammar , and even meillet conceded by 1925 that you cannot even demand a fragment of a grammar because there are perfectly well-established families where this either has not been or indeed cannot be done . it is another matter 9and ultimately a more interesting one ) that significant amount of grammatical comparison ( though not a whole grammar ) has been offered for nostratic ( a theory i find likely though perhaps not yet established ) as well as for amerind ( a theory which i find basically as unsupported as do karl and victor , for example ) . and it is perhaps not uninteresting that illich - svitych proposed to write a nostratic comparative grammar but never did , much as sapirpromised to write one for uto - aztecan but failed to ( though we should in all fairness note that sapir lived for another two decades , whereas illich - svitych died without even finishing the lexical and morphemic comparisons which are the bulk of the evidence that we have in the public domain for nostratic ) . this is no criticism of sapir , of course , if we agree that there was no need to write a comparatve grammar of uto - aztecan in order for everybody to be able to see that the uto - aztecan languages are related . just as there is no need for this in the case of nostratic 9and indeed given the age of proto - nostratic , if there was such a language , it seems unlkikely that we will ever have more than a very partial grammar

call for papers to the workshop connectionist - symbolic integration : from unified to hybrid approaches to be held at ijcai ' 95 montreal , canada august 19-20 , 1994 there has been a considerable amount of research in integrating connectionist and symbolic processing . while such an approach has clear advantages , it also encounters serious difficulties and challenges . therefore , various models and ideas have been proposed to address various problems and aspects in this integration . there is a growing interest from many segments of the ai community , ranging from expert systems , to cognitive modeling , to logical reasoning . two major trends can be identified in the state of the art : these are the unified or purely and the hybrid approaches to integration . whereas the purely connectionist ( " connectionist-to - the-top " ) approach claims that complex symbol processing functionalities can be achieved via neural networks alone , the hybrid approach is premised on the complementarity of the two paradigms and aims at their synergistic combination in systems comprising both neural and symbolic components . in fact , these trends can be viewed as two ends of an entire spectrum . up till now , overall , there is still relatively little work in comparing and combining these fairly isolated efforts . this workshop will provide a forum for discussions and exchanges of ideas in this area , to foster cooperative work . the workshop will tackle important issues in integrating connectionist and symbolic processing . a tentative schedule day 1 : a . introduction : * invited talks these talks will provide an overview of the field and set the tone for ensuing discussions . * theoretical foundations for integrating connectionist and symbolic processing b . definition of the two approaches : * do they exhaust the space of current research in connectionist-symbolic integration , or is there room for additional categories ? * how do we compare the unified and hybrid approaches ? * do the unified and hybrid approaches constitute a clearcut dichotomy or are they just endpoints of a continuum ? * what class of processes and problems is well-suited to unified or hybrid integration ? the relevant motivations and objectives . * what type of model is suitable for what type of application ? enumerate viable target domains . c . state of the art : * recent or ongoing theoretical or experimental research work * implemented models belonging to either the unified or hybrid approach * practical applications of both types of systems research addressing key issues concerning : * the unified approach : theoretical or practical issues involving systematicity , compositionality and variable binding , biologically inspired models , connectionist knowledge representation , other high-level connectionist models . * the hybrid approach : modes and methods of coupling , task sharing between various components of a hybrid system , knowledge representation and sharing . * both : commonsense reasoning , natural language processing , analogical reasoning , and more generally applications of unified and hybrid models . day 2 : d . cognitive aspects : * cognitive plausibility and relations to other ai paradigms * in cognitive modeling , why should we integrate connectionist and symbolic processing ? * is there a clear cognitive rationale for such integration ? ( we may need to examine in detail some typical areas , such as commonsense reasoning , and natural language processing ) * is there psychological and / or biological evidence for existing models ? if so , what is it ? e . open research issues : * can we now propose a common terminology with precise definitions for both approaches to connectionist-symbolic integration and for the location on the continuum ? * how far can unified systems go ? can unified models be supplemented by hybrid models ? can hybrid models be supplanted by unified models ? * limitations and barriers faced by both approaches * what breakthroughs are needed for both approaches ? * is it possible to synthesize various existing models ? workshop format - panel discussions - mini-group discussions : participants will break into groups of 7 / 8 to discuss a given theme ; group leaders will then form a panel to report on group discussions and attempt a synthesis with audience participation - interactive talks : this is a novel type of oral presentation we will experiment with . instead of a classical presentation , the speaker will present a problem or issue and give a brief statement of his personal stand ( 5 min ) to launch discussions which he will then moderate and conclude . - classical slide talks followed by q / a and discussions . workshop co - chairs : frederic alexandre , crin - cnrs / inria - lorraine ron sun , the university of alabama organizing committee : john barnden , new mexico state university steve gallant , belmont research inc . larry medsker , american university christian pellegrini , university of geneva noel sharkey , sheffield university program committee : lawrence bookman ( sun laboratory , usa ) michael dyer ( ucla , usa ) wolfgang ertel ( frw , germany ) limin fu ( university of florida , usa ) jose gonzalez - cristobal ( upm , spain ) ruben gonzalez - rubio ( university of sherbrooke , canada ) jean - paul haton ( crin - inria , france ) melanie hilario ( university of geneva , switzerland ) abderrahim labbi ( imag , france ) ronald yager ( iona college , usa ) schedule : - the submission deadline for participants is february 1 , 1995 . - the authors and potential participants will be notified the acceptance decision by march 15 , 1995 . - the camera-ready copies of working notes papers will be due on april 15 , 1995 submission : - if you wish to present a talk , specify the preferred type of presentation ( classical or interactive talk ) and submit 5 copies of an extended abstract ( within the limit of 5 - 7 pages ) to : ron sun department of computer science the university of alabama tuscaloosa , al 35487 rsun @ cs . ua . edu ( 205 ) 348-6363 - if you only wish to attend the workshop , send 5 copies of a short ( no more than one page ) description of your interest to the same address above . - please be sure to include your e-mail address in all submissions .

Subject: shareware mac concordance program available

i am making available a shareware concordance program for the macintosh called monoconc . the program is somewhat slow ( about 70 hits a minute ) , but it handles the basics . monoconc works with text-only files and produces a concordance in a " key word in context " format . the search term can be a word ( or part of a word , e . g . linguist * ) or a phrase . the resulting concordance can be sorted 1r ( first right ) , 1l , 2r , and 2l . the amount of context shown in the concordance lines can be adjusted , and clicking on a particular concordance line will bring half a dozen or so lines from the original text into a context window . in addition , a collocation screen gives the number of occurrences of all the words occurring in positions 3l , 2l , 1l , 1r , 2r , and 3r . it is possible to exclude certain words ( e . g . , function words ) from the count . there is also a simple graphical representation of the main collocates . the concordance and collocation results can be saved to a file or printed . i plan to post the program to a couple of ftp sites . ( if you are reading this in january 1995 , then you can try ftping to rice university at ftp . rice . edu . the program will be in the folder pub or pub \ linguistics . alternatively , in the new year you can try john lawler 's linguistics archive at the university of michigan . ) the program ( on a disk ) and a manual can also be purchased from athelstan ( 800-598 - 3880 ) . for those who would like a copy of the program before christmas , i can send a binhex version ( about 1400k ) via email - - assuming i do n't get too many requests . michael barlow barlow @ ruf . rice . edu

Subject: web promotion spider

created specifically to meet the needs of those who want their web pages to get noticed and placed in the top of the search engines ! the spider automates the process of submitting your site and uses powerful technology to get your site listed in the top positions . we ' ve developed the web promote spider for windows 95 and nt . this amazing program automatically submits your site to over 250 ( the list grows daily ) major search engines and directories ! plus , the web promote spider has an expert html reader system inside . it will change certain contents of your html text and automatically prepare needed information for online registration in search engines to optimize your pages and get them listed on top . originally engineered for use by the professional advertising industry , this program is easy and intuitive to use . beginners will be amazed at how simple it is to take complete control over their search engines and index marketing efforts . the web promote spider is an industrial strength marketing tool and an extremely valuable part of any publicity campaign . with this kind of power , it should come as no surprise that many of our customers have even built profitable on-line promotional businesses with this product and their existing internet connection ! with your payment of only $ 49 . 95 ( standard version ) you will receive the current web promotion spider program . also , you can have all the new upgrades free . each upgrade will have a list of new internet search engines / online directories and , of course , new features . plus , you get free upgrades which come out twice a month with new features and new search engines . register now and you ' ll continue to get our upgrades , which keep the program up-to - date and getting better and better ! now submitting to 250 + search engines , free . we are proud to announce that we now have two powerful versions of the web promote spider , our standard version and our brand new pro version . our standard version is designed for those individuals who have one or two sites that they want to be able to submit , and want to see dramatic increases in their sites visibility . our pro version is designed for isp 's , webmasters , hosting providers , and anyone who has multiple sites they need to promote thoroughly . while the standard version does track all registration campaigns for you , it can still be somewhat time intensive if you register several sites at once , or on a regular basis . you can see why the web promote spider is taking the net by storm ! professional version while the standard version of this product seems to meet the promotional needs of most of our customers , we also recognize the need for an ' industrial strength ' version of web promote spider . the professional version is designed for isp 's , webmasters , hosting providers , and anyone who has multiple sites they need to promote thoroughly . while the standard version tracks all registration campaigns for you , it can still be time intensive if you have to register several sites at once . to make this easier and more efficient for our customers , we have added several new features to the brand new professional version : deep promotion - this feature will automatically explore every internal link in your site , and develop registration information for each page for you automatically . for instance , in the standard version , if you have a 30 page site , you would have to run web promote spider thirty times , manually inputting each page into the registration queue . in the professional version , this is all automatic , and can be done in a matter of minutes . batch processing - if you are responsible for registering or maintaining several sites , you will find this feature particularly useful . you can load in multiple sites , and set the program to run all the sites at once , generating and saving a separate registration report on each . this report can easily be copied to the windows clipboard for pasting into reports , email , etc . expanded promotion resources - while the standard version of the spider will submit to 250 registration resources this list will continue to grow but not as quickly as what 's being planned on the professional version . the pro version currently has 400 and will soon have at least 1 , 000 automatic registration options / resources . if you ' re a previous owner of the standard version , the cost is only $ 49 . 95 to upgrade ! if you ' re a first time user and would like to start using the pro version right away , the cost is $ 99 . 90 . for more info please visit our web site at : http : / / www . gaura . com / software / sys . htm to order order by fax visa or mastercard fax : ( 425 ) 379-9722 we will give you the address to download the program or for an extra $ 10 . 00 we ' ll send your the program on cd - rom name : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ address : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ city : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ state : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ zip : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ home phone : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ work phone : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ fax : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ e - mail _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ standard version $ 49 . 95 _ _ pro version $ 99 . 90 _ _ upgrade $ 49 . 95 ( from standard to pro , if you already have the standard version ) _ _ _ send cd - rom $ 10 . 00 _ _ _ provide download address . . no charge _ _ _ _ _ total visa _ _ _ mastercard _ _ _ _ account number : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ expiration date : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ i understand that all sales are final . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ signature - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Subject: hi !

* * * this is not spam ! * * * my name is matthew . i make a habit of deleting mail i have not yet read , as i ' m sure you do also . please read this one though , you might find this interesting . i recently lost my high paying job from a major computer corporation due to their loss of a major contract . they messed up , but that whole dep ' t of 15 people including myself are hung out to dry . corporate america at it 's finest . i have not had luck yet finding another job , as my skills were very specific to that company and not really worth anything to another company . during the time i worked there , i also bought and sold real estate like those guys on tv . ( yes , you can do that and make it work for you too ) the key is i made it work . i was fairly successful until the " nightmare on pleasant st . " as my friends and i call it . . . i lost most of my money in that one bad deal and i was no longer financially secure and i relied heavily on my income from my former job . as you ' ve already heard , i lost that too and i started to look for other things i could make money to help me get back on my feet . so , i started to read all of the junk that people have mailed to me . let me tell you , i can't believe some of the things out there . . . what a waste of time . until i saw this . hold on . i know you are ( like i was ) ready to stop reading right here . i implore you not to . i ( like you ) am not some non-educated fool . i have made much money for myself in real estate , which is not an easy business . i am a rather competent business man . at least finish reading this until the end . * * better still : print this letter and read it in comfort over , and over here is what i saw . . . * i only needed $ 20 extra dollars to try this * this is making money for people who at least tried a little , so why not me too ? in desparation , i sent the four 5 dollar bills and got the reports . as i always have , i made this work for me too . i took much time and effort to learn about e-mail ( which is a great and free tool ! ! ) and how to send lots of it . now , 19 days after my first mailing of this , i have received roughly 8 , 450 responses . ( trust me , when my fiance ` saw 8 , 450 5 dollar bills on the kitchen table , she no longer laughed at me for trying this ) i wrote a report of my own showing step by step how to do the same which i will give to you for free as a helping hand so we can all continue this success . i will show you every step of cutting , pasting , editing this letter to include your name and address , etc . here is my special offer to help you . . . . as long as my address , basquiat at the evanston po box is on the list below i will send the step-by - step instructions and 100 , 000 e-mail addresses to anyone who orders any report from me . it took some time and expense to put this list together so all i ask is that you add another $ 5 for handling the addresses . the instructions for e _ mailing are free . they will come to you in a . txt format ( which i will teach you how to use in the instructions i ' ve put together ) and less than 2 % will be duplicates . you will get the list of addresses with your report . the first 160 people who order a report from me will receive a different set of addresses . this is my gift to you to help you get started . . . . i promise you , if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up ( and count your money ! ) , you will make at least as much money as i am . you do n't need to be a whiz at the computer , but i ' ll bet you already are . if you can open an envelope , remove the money , and send an e-mail message , then you ' re on your way to the bank . take the time to read this so you ' ll understand how easy it is . if i can do this , so can you ! add this e-mail to ' favorite places ' by dragging the heart at the upper right corner of this window to the heart / folder picture next to the file cabinet . that way , you will have a copy of this for future use . go for it now ! ! matthew the following is a copy of the e-mail i read : $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ this is a legal , money-making phenomenon . print this letter , read the directions , then read it again ! ! ! you are about to embark on the most profitable and unique program you may ever see . many times over , it has demonstrated and proven its ability to generate large amounts of cash . this program is showing fantastic appeal with a huge and ever-growing on-line population desirous of additional income . this is a legitimate , legal , money-making opportunity . it does not require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house , except to get the mail and go to the bank !

the $ 5 . 00 is yours ! this is the easiest electronic business anywhere ! follow the instructions to the letter and be prepared to reap the staggering benefits ! * * * * * * * i n s t r u c t i o n s * * * * * * * this is what you must do : 1 . order all 4 reports shown on the list below ( you can't sell them if you do n't order them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e-mail address , and your return postal address ( in case of a problem ) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report . * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the four reports . you will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e-mail , each of the four save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send reports to the 1 , 000 's of people who will order them from you 2 . important - - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than is instructed below in steps " a " through " d " or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you ' ll also see how it does n't work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you ' ve ordered the four reports , replace the name and address under report # 1 with your name and address , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . c . move the name and address that was under report # 2 down to report # 3 . d . move the name and address that was under report # 3 down to report # 4 . e . the name and address that was under report # 4 is removed from the list and has no doubt collected their 50 grand . please make sure you copy everyone 's name and address accurately !

Subject: dated material

please follow the instructions of this letter very carefully , immediately print and read twice . greetings hopefully my name is still on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is the same as the letter in front of you now . he asked me to verify the fact that this letter was legal . i told him that i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off-the - wall idea to make money . a week later i met again with my client to discuss the issue . i told him that the letter originally brought to me was not 100 % legal . my client asked me to alter the letter to make it 100 % legal . i advised him to make a small change in the letter and it will be all right . i was curious about the letter , so he told me how it works . i thought it was a long shot , so i decided against participating . before my client left , i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later he called to tell me that he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! ! i did n't believe him so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself . i thought about it for a few days and decided that there was not much to lose . i followed the instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters . sure enough the money started coming in ! it came slowly at first , but after three weeks i was getting more than i could open in a day . after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it totaled $ 868 , 439 . 00 . i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i told myself if things worked out i would retire from practice and play golf . i decided to try the letter again , but this time i sent out 500 letters out . well , three months after that i had totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 . 00 ! i just could n't believe it . i met my old client for lunch to find out how this exactly works . he told me that there were a few similar letters going around . what made this one different is the fact that there are seven names on the letter , not five like most others . that fact alone resulted in more returns . the other factor was the advice i gave him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal , since no one wants to risk doing anything illegal . i bet now you are curious about what little changes i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to be legal , you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar . i told him that anyone sending a dollar out must receive something in return . so when you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list , you must include a slip of paper saying " please put me on your mailing list " and include your name , mailing address and e-mail address ( your phone # is optional ) . this is the key to the program ! the item you will receive for your dollar you send to the seven names below , is this letter and the right to earn thousands . we will be working together to improve each other 's lives ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in less than three months you will receive over $ 800 , 000 . 00 guaranteed ! ! ! ! a ) immediately send $ 1 . 00 to each of the seven people listed below . wrap the dollar in a note ( type or handwritten ) saying " please add me to your mailing list " and include your name , mailing address , and e-mail address . your phone number is optional . 1 - jal 8401 e . 60th st . # 2811 tulsa , ok 74145-5075 2 - lbm enterprises 167 hamilton st . oceanside , ca 92054 3 - s + k industries 641a puller pl san clemente , ca 92672 4 - smooth enterprises 205-38 abeyta ct , oceanside , ca 92054 5 - d&k cybermart 2281 annadale way , chula vista ca 91915 6 - arawak , 2442 n . main st . , suite 185 , gainesville , fl 32609 7 - mike m , p . o . box 89009 cp elysee , laval , quebec , h7w 5k1 b ) remove the name next to # 1 at the top of the list and move the rest of the names up on position . then place your name in the # 7 spot . this is best done by saving this to a file and enter in your information on line # 7 . be very careful when you type the addresses and proof read them . c ) when you have completed the above instructions you have options of mailing your new letter in two ways 1 ) through us postal service or 2 ) through e-mail . this letter has been proven perfectly legal for both ways as long as you follow the above instructions , because you ' re purchasing membership in our exclusive mailing list . to mail this out over the internet , you could browse through areas and find people to send this to all the time . all you have to do is cut and paste e-mail addresses wherever you are on the internet . remember , it does n't cost anything to mail on the internet . or you can use a mass e-mail network to mail it out in large volumes for you . we highly recommend this one . they always e-mail more than the amount you purchase and their addresses are fresh . e - mail this letter to them with your name and address in position # 7 above . bulk email is highly recommended for ease and efficiency . newsgroups tend to be very unreliable . just do a search on the web for bulk email . * * you will want to e-mail this to as many people as you can . this will bring you big payoffs . this company has been most effective for this program . * * * keep in mind that there is no limit to the amount of names you could send out . the more names you send the more money you will make . we strongly encourage you to mail this letter to family and friends and relatives as well . * * * this is a service and is 100 % legal ! ! ! ( refer to title 18 , section 1302 & 1342 of the u . s . postal and lottery laws ) assume for example you get a 7 . 5 % return rate , which is very conservative . my first attempt was about 9 . 5 % and my second time was over 11 % 1 ) when you mail out 200 letters , 15 people will send you $ 1 . 00 2 ) those 15 people mail out 200 letters and 225 people send you $ 1 . 00 3 ) those 225 people mail out 200 letters and 3 , 375 people send you $ 1 . 00 4 ) those 3 , 375 people mail out 200 letters and 50 , 625 people send you $ 1 . 00 5 ) those 50 , 625 people mail out 200 letters and 759 , 375 people send you $ 1 . 00 6 ) those 759 , 375 people mail out 200 letter and 11 , 390 , 625 people send you $ 1 . 00 at this point your name drops off the list . think about it . with only the first six levels you have received over $ 813 , 615 . 00 ! it works every time , but how well depends on how many letters you send out . in the example above you mailed out 200 letters , if you mailed out 500 letters , you would have received over $ 2 , 006 , 917 . 00 check the math yourself , i want you to , but i guarantee it is correct ! with this kind of return , you ' ve got to try it . try it once and you will do it again - guaranteed ! just make sure you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list with a note to be added to their mailing list . together we will all prosper ! ! ! ps you ' ve read this far , so let me ask you one simple question . q - what have you got to lose a - only $ 7 . 00 what you can gain is an income , like the example in the letter . very small risk . very small expense , huge potential returns ! what do you have to lose ? i invite you to join our mailing list today ! wishing you happy success ! p . p . s . we have a 95 % return at this point ! ! !

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to " forge " headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the " to " " from " and " reply to " portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our " global remove list " simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately

Subject: just released ! 10 million ! ! !

it was just released ! ! introducing . . . millions vol . 1a we took a total of over 92 million email addresses from many of the touted cd 's that are out there ( bought them all - some were $ 300 + ) ! we added the millions we had in storage to those . when we combined them all , we had in excess of 100 + million addresses in one huge file . we then ran a super " sort / de-dupe " program against this huge list . it cut the file down to less than 25 million ! ! ! can you believe that ? it seems that most people that are selling cd 's are duping the public by putting numerous files of addresses in the cd over and over . this created many duplicate addresses . they also had many program " generated " email addresses like compuserve , mci , anon 's , etc . this causes a tremendous amount of undeliverables , and for those that use stealth programs , clogs up servers quickly with trash , etc . we then ran a program that contained 1800 + keywords to remove addresses with vulgarity , profanity , sex-related names , postmaster , webmaster , flamer , abuse , spam , etc . , etc . also eliminated all . edu , . mil , . org , . gov , etc . after that list was run against the remaining list , it reduced it down to near 10 million addresses ! so , you see , our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all others that are out there on cd and otherwise . using ours will be like using the 100 + million that we started with , but a lot less money and alot less time ! ! we also purchased cyber - promos ( $ 995 . 00 ) cd . we received it just prior to finishing production work on the new cd . we had our people take a random sample of 300 , 000 addresses from the touted 2 . 9 that they advertised . we used a program that allows us to take a random sample of addresses from any list . we were able to have the program take every 9th address , thus giving us a 300 , 000 list of cyber 's email addresses from top to bottom . we cleaned these , and came up with about 100 , 000 addresses . these are also mixed in . we also included a 6 + million " remove / flamer " file broke into seperate files for ease of extracting and adding to your own database of removes . " you can buy from the rest or you can buy from the best . your choice . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ what others are saying : " i received the cd on friday evening . like a kid with a new toy , i immediately started bulking out using the new email addresses . over the course of the weekend , i emailed out over 500 , 000 emails and i received less than twenty undeliverables ! ! i am totally satisfied with my purchase ! ! thanks premier ! !

( does that - really - surprise you ? ) 5 . when spammers register domain names with internic they never pay their bills because they know that the domain will be blocked and useless within 30 days , and interring gives them that long to pay before cutting them off . 6 . some spammers buy lists of accounts from hackers that have broken into internet service providers and use these accounts , that belong to other people , so they can connect to the internet without being concerned about losing the account . again , you get the blame , you lose your account . most of these spammers are genuine , authentic , certified jerks . i decided to get even , i took all of this very personally . within 3 weeks , the spam had dropped to a trickle . now i only get 2 or 3 a week instead of 7 or 8 each day . update : as of 02-oct - 1998 i have not gotten a single spam for 5 days . that 's a fact . i am starting to get comments from people that joined me two weeks ago that have noticed drops in their spam count of as much as 70 % . that is a fact as well . my list of active spammers is over 80 individuals now and it is growing every day . it does n't take government intervention , we all know that our government could n't feed a cat without spending $ 400 on a bag of cat food and starting 8 committees . what it does take is someone with the guts to take action , now ! what did i do ? first i recognized that spammers are not going to just quit , they make too much money doing it . the self righteous " anti-spammers " only wipeout mostly innocent business people with poor judgment . they have not put a single spam mailer out of business yet . not a one ! they just pop up with a different domain name , and dialup account the next day . the anti spammers have actually wiped out several potentially successful remove lists . you know why ? they do n't want it to end because then they would n't have a crusade anymore . think i ' m kidding ? i know who the anti-spammers are as well and believe me , their motivations are purely egotistical . in my opinion they have made spam worse by driving it underground and ruining the web based remove lists . try to go to www . remove-list . com , it is n't there anymore . so i am doing it different . human nature matters . . . i used my investigative experience to hunt down the - actual people - that were sending me spam . names , phone numbers , addresses , etc . it was n't easy but i had the background and knowledge to do it . i called each of these people and told them that if they did not immediately cease and desist sending mail to my address that i was going to give their name , address , phone number and anything else i had on them to every service provider in the country . that i would publish their information on the internet via the web , and that i would give their information to every ( legitimate ) anti - spam group i could find . i was polite and adult about the issue but i made it very clear that i was dead serious . nothing else has worked . people have been trying to get rid of spam for several years with no success . this method works ! ! ! if i told you i could do the same thing for you would you be interested ? i thought so . here is what you need to do : first : start your text editor ( notepad , vi , whatever ) second : type the following information and print it . first name last name primary email address ( remember your email may have two forms such as : joe @ isp . com and joe @ mail . isp . com . include both , contact your isp if you are n't sure ) family member ' s addresses ( one per line please ! ) third : mail this information to me : robert young attn : no more spam please ! ! ! c / o super fast services 116 e . 3rd . st . suite 206 moscow , id 83843 we need donations to support this fight . i started out doing this for friends and family , then their friends and family , and now it is starting to cost us a lot of money . please include a donation of five dollars either a five dollar bill , or a check made out to me . we are hoping that there are enough decent people out there that appreciate what we are doing and will pitch in a few bucks to help us pay for the phone calls , computer time , database searches , and hiring people to do the data entry for the 600 plus letters we are getting every day . p l e a s e h e l p ! i guarantee you will think it is the best five bucks you have ever spent if you are sick of spam . thanks for taking the time to reply to this letter , i hope to hear from you soon . working together we can defeat unwanted spam for good .

the bank software that come with a solid database to help you manage your clientele and your fees , and the check writing module that allows you to download check files from the bank and print reatime refunds checks to your clients ; the eepp communication module that makes the transmission of your clients ' return information to the irs as easy as pressing a button ; and finally the eepp windows interface that seamlessly integrates all those valuable goodies in one piece of software . all this for only $ 596 . 00 . no royalty fee to pay , no adversing fee . all the profits are yours to keep . but we still think that an initial investment of $ 596 . 00 in a business you do n't know about may constitute a string significant enough to hold you back . so , to facilitate the entry to new subscribers we pay up to $ 397 . 00 off your first year eepp software package . leaving you with an initial investment of $ 199 . 00 . we are some kind of millionaires who are just giving money away , nor are we going to pretend that we are in this just to help you . no . we are in it just like you to make money . and we make money only when you make money . all the details you might need to understand how the electronic filing program and the eepp offer work are posted on the eepp web site . all the forms and applications you need to sign up , and make payment for subscription fee over the internet are also available on line . but , you will agree with me , if that site was advertised on the giant search engines , the information it contains would not be so valuable because the information it contains would become public domain . your prospective clients could access the same information that makes your business worth what it 's worth . if time is money , business is information . and that is why we give access to the eepp site to people who really mean to be in business . for the web address , and your partner id number ( pidn ) , just reply to this message ( by clicking on the reply to the author icon , if you are using microsoft internet explorer ) , or direct your inquiry and questions to tax _ biz _ 4 _ u @ hotmail . com , call in your inquiry at ( 407 ) 895-2306 . but why pay a phone call when it 's free to email ? do n't wait any longer . some of the discounts are available in limited quantity only .

Subject: you have to see this

i never thought i 'd be the one telling you this : i actually read a piece of e - mail & i ' m going to europe on the proceeds ! hello ! my name is karen liddell ; i ' m a 35 - year-old mom , wife , and part-time = accountant . as a rule , i delete all unsolicited " junk " e-mail and use = my account primarily for business . i received what i assumed was this = same e-mail countless times and deleted it each time . about two months ago i received it again and , because of the catchy = subject line , i finally read it . afterwards , i thought , " ok , i give = in , i ' m going to try this . i can certainly afford to invest $ 20 and , on = the other hand , there 's nothing wrong with creating a little excess = cash . " i promptly mailed four $ 5 bills and , after receiving the = reports , paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail = advertisements for me . after reading the reports , i also learned how = easy it is to bulk e-mail for free ! = 20 i was not prepared for the results . everyday for the last six weeks , my = p . o . box has been overflowing with $ 5 bills ; many days the excess fills = up an extra mail bin and i ' ve had to upgrade to the corporate-size box ! = i am stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in ! i know it 's hard to believe , and there are those who will say it does n't = work , but it does ! my husband and i have been saving for several years to make a = substantial downpayment on a house . now , not only are we purchasing a = house with 40 % down , we ' re going to venice , italy to celebrate ! i promise you , if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be = prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up = ( and count your money ! ) , you will make at least as much money as we did . = you do n't need to be a wiz at the computer , but i ' ll bet you already = are . if you can open an envelope , remove the money , and send an e-mail = message , then you ' re on your way to the bank . take the time to read = this so you ' ll understand how easy it is . i was once a skeptic and if i = can do this , so can you ! the following is a copy of the e-mail i read : $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ this is a legal , money-making phenomenon . print this letter , read the directions , then read it again ! ! ! you are about to embark on the most profitable and unique program you = may ever see . many times over , it has demonstrated and proven its = ability to generate large amounts of cash . this program is showing = fantastic appeal with a huge and ever-growing on-line population = desirous of additional income . this is a legitimate , legal , money-making opportunity . it does not = require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and best = of all , you never have to leave the house , except to get the mail and go = to the bank ! = 20 this truly is the lucky break you ' ve been waiting for ! simply follow = the easy instructions in this letter , and your financial dreams will = come true ! when followed correctly , this multi-level marketing program = works perfectly . . 100 % every time !

Subject: skytop sales - - save over $ 100 on a digital camera !

if you ' ve been searching for a high-resolution , feature-laden digital camera that produces images with incredible levels of detail and color depth , and which has a price tag that won't break the bank , well , you ' ve probably wondered if such an unlikely animal exists . . . it does . and skytop sales has it . http : / / 207 . 13 . 239 . 101 / cgi-bin / rtr ? 91byvpm1scp9pdbo3lc0hxy5klcz3c announcing the svmini - 209 from sound vision - - a digital camera that utilizes the latest technology to deliver ultrahigh-quality images ( 2000x1600 pixels ! ) at an affordable price . never heard of sound vision ? you probably know their products . sound vision is a camera manufacturer . their customers , in most cases , are large companies who brand the cameras sound vision makes and resell them as their own . one such company , for example , is selling a sound vision camera under its own very well-known label ; that camera retails for $ 479 . ( or more . the middlemen have to make their dough , of course . ) that same camera under the original manufacturer ' s label is called the sound vision svmini - 209 . through skytop sales , it 's only $ 349 . by sacrificing the big label and eliminating the middlemen , you save eighty bucks on the identical unit . and to sweeten the deal even further , we ' ll include $ 125 worth of memory enhancements at no additional cost . to have a look at the svmini - 209 , please visit our web site by following the link below . ( and bear in mind that you ' ve probably already seen this camera , if you ' ve been doing any comparison shopping . it just had a different name , and cost more . ) http : / / 207 . 13 . 239 . 101 / cgi-bin / rtr ? 91byvpm1scp9pdbo3lc0hxy5klcz3c the most camera your money can buy . . . sound vision uses new cmos sensor technology at the heart of its svmini - 209 to deliver greatly increased resolution at a lower cost . in fact , sound vision 's cameras were the first on the market to use cmos sensors instead of the traditional ccd sensors used in other digital cameras . the benefits of cmos technology : - higher resolution - - the svmini - 209 captures huge 3 . 2 megapixel images ( that 's 2000x1600 pixels ! ) - lower cost than ccds - - get more camera for the dollar - lower power draw - - dramatically increased battery life knock-out images and accompanying sound can be stored either in camera internal memory or on removable flash memory cards , both linear and sandisk . level - selectable jpeg compression allows you to find the right balance of image quality and memory economy . ( the module which allows the svmini - 209 to use sandisk cards , called the minidisk option , normally is a separate purchase . like we said : we ' re throwing it in for free . that , and a free 2 mb sandisk card - - a combined value of $ 125 ! ) taking great photos with the svmini - 209 is effortless . in addition to the red , green , and blue color receptors common to other digital cameras , the svmini - 209 features a fourth receptor for teal , which dramatically increases possible color depth ( and , in fact , more closely mimics the capabilities of the human retina ) . a sophisticated auto-exposure algorithm prevents the over-saturation of highlights while still preserving shadow detail . an automatic electronic flash guarantees that your shots will be lit to perfection , every time . the experts know . . . byte magazine reviewed the svmini - 209 in its november ' 97 issue , and gave the camera the highest rating , five stars . byte says , " . . . it delivers ultra-high quality digital images at a relatively bargain price . " ( the bargain price they ' re talking about is $ 479 . we ' re offering $ 100 + savings over the bargain price . ) to learn more about this outstanding camera , and for a comprehensive discussion of its features , ( and to order ! ) follow the link below : http : / / 207 . 13 . 239 . 101 / cgi-bin / rtr ? 91byvpm1scp9pdbo3lc0hxy5klcz3c prices for digital cameras span the spectrum . compare its features and benefits with other cameras , and you ' ll find that the svmini - 209 is way more camera for way less cost . compare its features and benefits with the same camera under a popular brand name , and you ' ll find that the svmini - 209 is the identical camera for waaay less cost . thanks for your time ! your friends at skytop sales p . s . digital images have so many fantastic applications : spice up a business proposal or presentation , design a dazzling web site , email photos to friends and family all over the world , create your own photo art using one of the popular graphics programs on the market . the possibilities are endless . . . and with the ultrahigh-quality images of the svmini - 209 in hand , you ' re limited only by your imagination . p . p . s . our agreement with soundvision allows us to sell the svmini - 209 for $ 349 for a limited time only . please act quickly . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - this mailing is intended to be of interest to a large audience and to communicate a valuable offer . if you have no interest in this offer , be advised that other valuable promotions will be featured in future mailings which may be of interest to you . however , if you have no desire to receive offers of value from us in the future , please click the link below to remove yourself from our mailing list . http : / / 207 . 13 . 239 . 101 / cgi-bin / rem ? vbanaqeanvsuprqpnpphx copyright 1998 , skytop sales . the information contained in this email message may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or otherwise distributed without the express written consent of skytop sales .

Subject: save money on your phone bill

i hope you do n't object to a complete stranger mailing you this , but i believe this to be an opportunity too good to be missed by anyone . i ' m looking forward to saving money on my phone bill and so can you : - to save money on your phone bill please read this message carefully tcw telecoms direct ltd least cost routing gives you the opportunity to save money on all of your phone bills all of the time . how much will you save ? local calls 15 % regional calls 30 % national calls 30 % international calls 30 % landline to mobile 10 % ( discounts shown are against bt standard rates . rates track bt on a daily basis , for pricing information see bt ) now here comes the best bit - you can save even more every month by referring friends . simply tell your friends about the tcw lcr service . give them your customer number ( located on the top left of your contract when you have become a customer ) ( call 01235 442350 and quote account number de / 184374 to become a customer yourself ) ask your friends to call tcw telecoms direct ltd on 01235 442350 . let tcw telecoms direct ltd do the rest . how will tcw thank you ? you ' ll receive credits for every month that your recommended friends continue to use the tcw service . every month there will be a loyalty referral discount on your bill . the more friends you refer , the greater your monthly credit will become - and yes - this credit is every month . so become a tcw customer now and then call your friends . in time , your phone bill from tcw telecoms direct could read zero ! how do you become a tcw customer ? call tcw telecoms direct ltd on 01235 442350 now and give them the account number de / 184374 - you , me and your friends will soon be saving money on your phone bills - even more so if you all recommend the service to others . good luck and here 's to smaller phone bills for everyone ! ! more details follow for those wishing to know more about how this service works if you are already receiving discounts from bt or your cable operator , you may not see the benefit of using the tcw service as the discounts above may not seem attractive . however , remember that by recommending friends your resultant discounts over bt standard rates could become 100 % every month due to the referral credits appearing on your tcw bill . in other words , by recommending friends you can reduce your tcw bill to zero over time . i have just asked tcw / telecoms direct customer service what happens to calls to numbers such as 0845 that get used for internet access , and apparently these are discounted the same as local calls , i . e . 15 % ( or more when you recommend friends ) . please call them yourself to confirm on 01235 442350 . what is least cost routing ? least cost routing is a system designed to save you money on all your local , regional , national and international calls as well as calls to mobile phones . why is least cost routing allowed to exist ? least cost routing is relatively new in the uk and has come about since the government passed a bill to deregulate the national telephone system . this ended the bt monopoly , allowing tcw telecom direct to offer you a highly competitive service with substantial discounts on your calls . how does it work ? least cost routing works by simply re-routing your calls through tcw 's billing system . it does this via a free " smart box " that attaches to your phone and bt or cable socket . in other words , you keep your existing telephone number , dial as normal , and receive exactly the same high quality service . you will then receive a bill from your existing telephone company for line rental and maybe some specialised calls and another bill ( lower than before ) from tcw for your local , regional , national and international calls as well as calls to mobile phones . your combined bill will , of course be lower . effectively nothing changes , but the total price you pay . the " smart box " is plugged into your existing bt or cable wall socket which is used for the majority of your calls . your phone is then plugged into the " smart box " . you then use your phone as per normal and save money . if there is heavy usage from another extension , you may consider requesting a second smart box . there is no minimum contract period . what will your bill from tcw show ? fully itemised call details with number of calls , type of calls ( local , regional , national , international , mobile ) , duration of calls , cost of each call , how much the calls would have cost without least cost routing .

Subject: just in time ! ! extra money for christmas

you can earn $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days sending e-mail , seem impossible ? read on for details . " as seen on national t . v . ! ! thank you for your time and interest . this is the letter you ' ve been reading about in the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . their findings proved , once and for all , that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program . this has helped to show people that this is a simple , harmless and fun way to make some extra money at home . the results of this show has been truly remarkable . so many people are participating that those involved are doing , much better than ever before . since everyone makes more as more people try it out , its been very exciting to be a part of it lately . you will understand once you experience it . " here it is below " = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = * * * print this now for future reference * * * the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at . it can be started with very little investment and the income return is tremendous ! ! ! $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ if you would like to make at least $ 50 , 000 in less than 90 days ! please read the enclosed program . . . then read it again ! ! ! $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come into contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dreams will come true . this multi-level e-mail order marketing program works perfectly 100 % every time . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e - mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . you may have heard this story before , but over the summer donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show . dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch . without hesitating , trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work . the audience started to hoot and boo him . he looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response " that 's why i ' m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there ! " the enclosed information is something i almost slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is johnathon rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year , it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1997 1 received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1-800 - 725-2161 24 - hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided " why not . " initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , my only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not " rip-off " anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , 1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . your goal is to " receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! " my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in . 90 days was done . by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 . your goal is to " receive at least 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goa . l . " well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , 1 received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , johnathon rourke a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . the economy , inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . 1 do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , " the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . " the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to " move up " or " get rich " , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with " no risk " and " just a little bit of effort . " you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending thousands and thousands of programs . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! " think about it " before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think a-bout it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! jody jacobs , richmond , va here ' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ instructions : this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say " bull " , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e-mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do : 1 . order all 4 reports shown on the list below ( you can't sell them if you do n't order them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e-mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the four reports . you will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e-mail , each of the four reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 's of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their seqience on the list , in any way other than is instructed below in steps " a " through " f " or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you ' ll also see how it does n't work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you ' ve ordered the four reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 4 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . d . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 . e . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . f . insert your name / address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e - mail is free ! there are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e-mail let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 99q out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would hpppen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing , tell you where to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e - mail lists . method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet advertising on the ' net is very , very inexpensive , and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . let 's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level . ( placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . ) assuming that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below . ist level - - your 10 members with $ 5 - - $ 50 2nd level - - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) $ 500 3rd level - - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) $ 5 , 000 4th level - - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 , 000 ) . $ 50 , 000 this totals - - - - - - - - - - - - $ 55 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 's of participants ! think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must dc , is e-mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide same-day service on all orders ! this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report ! available reports * * * order each report by number and name - 1 - - * * notes : - always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report cheques not accepted - always send your order via first class mail - make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , include : ( a ) the number & name of the report you are ordering , ( b ) your e-mail address , and ( c ) your name & postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 " the insider 's guide to advertising for free on the internet " order report # 1 from : crossroads enterprises 5507-10 nesconset hwy . # 317 mt . siani , ny . 11766 report # 2 " the insider 's guide to sending bulk e - mail on the internet " order report # 2 from : laura waite rfd1 box 798 campton , nh . 03223 report # 3 " the secrets to multilevel marketing on the internet " order report 43 from : philip webster 1011 second st . port orange , fl . 32119 report # 4 " how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of multilevel marketing and the internet " order report # 4 from : patricia arnold 174 windward ct . s . port jefferson , ny . 11777 about 50 , 000 new people get online every month ! * * * * * * * tips for success * * * * * * * * * * treat this as your business ! be prompt , professional , and follow the directions accurately . * * * send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in because : when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the requested product / report . always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , your results will be successful ! above all , have faith in yourself and know you wilt , succeed ! * * * * * * * your success guidelines * * * * * * * follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do n't receive 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . then , a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 . if you do n't , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e - mails or continue placing ads and start the whole process again ! there is no limit to the income you will generate from this business ! before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate in this program . please answer one question . do you want to change your life ? if the answer is yes , please look at the following facts about this program : 1 . you are selling a product which does not cost anything to produce , ship or advertise . 2 . all of your customers pay you in cash ! 3 . e - mail is without question the most powerful method of distributing information on earth . this program combines the distribution power of e-mail together with the revenue generating power of multi-level marketing . 4 . your only expenses other than your initial $ 20 investment is your time ! 5 . virtually all of the income you generate from this program is pure profit ! 6 . this program will change your life forever . * * * * * * * t e s t i m o n i a l s * * * * * * * this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position , it won't work and you ' ll lose a lot of potential income . i ' m living proof that it works . it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money , with little cost to you . if you do choose to participate , follow the program exactly , and you ' ll be on your way to financial security . sean mclaughlin , jackson , ms the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 . 00 in the first 19 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , phillip a . brown , esq . not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n't get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i surprised when i found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders ! for a while , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i ' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n't matter where in the u . s . the people live . there simply is n't a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi . i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program . . . 11 months passed then it came . . . i did n't delete this one ! . . . i made more than $ 41 , 000 on the first try ! ! d . wilburn , muncie , in this is my third time to participate in this plan . we have quit our jobs , and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it . for your sake , and for your family 's sake do n't pass up this golden opportunity . good luck and happy spending ! charles fairchild , spokane , wa i am nearing the $ 90 , 000 mark from this program . i have used several forms of advertisement . i used regular mail and bulk email . the regular mail was very expensive for 2 reasons . i purchased a very select list names , and the postage . the 3rd time i sent out e - mails , in the quantity of 700 , 000 . so , after 3 times participating in this program , i am almost at the $ 90 , 000 mark . that is n't too bad . i hope the same success for you . good luck . . . . raymond mccormick , new cannan , ct . you have great potential for extra earnings that is available at your finger-tips ! you have unlimited access to wealth , but you must be willing to take that first step ! the media already proved that ! ! ! ! ! ! you could be making an obscene amount of money ! i have given you the information , materials , and opportunity to become financially better off . it is up to you now ! - think about it - your risk is only $ 20 . ?

" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20 to = 90 days was done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report = # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , " you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more = programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , = relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . " well , i had 196 orders for = report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march = 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in = every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . = 20 always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i ' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! " threw it away " " i had received this program before . i threw it away , but later wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get a copy , so i had to wait until i was emailed another copy of the program . eleven months passed , then it came . i didn ' t throw this one away . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try . " dawn w . , evansville , in " no free lunch " " my late father always told me , ' remember , alan , there is no free lunch in life . you get out of life what you put into it . ' through trial and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start , i finally figured it out . the program works very well , i just had to find the right target group of people to email it to . so far this year , i have made over $ 63 , 000 using this program . i know my dad would have been very proud of me . " alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , " the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . " the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to " move up " or " get rich " , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with " no risk " and " just a little bit of effort . " you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! " think about it " before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . = 20 any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to = will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for = a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do = that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is = practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is = being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and = 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at erris mail order marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use = $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20 to 90 days . before you say " bull " , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not = involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , = store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . dothis by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) = to the person listed for the specific report . international = = 20 orders should also include $ 2 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the required changes in the name list , save it as a text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever email program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email lists . step ( 4 ) email a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous = 20 money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , email to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . 00 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four 4 reports . always provide same-day service on all orders !
