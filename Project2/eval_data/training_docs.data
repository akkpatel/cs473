Subject: more on human subjects

a number of months ago i raised the issue of dealing with human subjects committees , since our department was being ( as we perceived it ) hassled by our own committee . i received numerous responses , which i have since forwarded to the lsa social issues ( or something ) committee . the responses varied from shocked outrage that anyone would look over our ( collective ) shoulders from shocked outrage that i would consider doing any research without asking permission . the primary hassle , which was reflected again in the more recent posting on the subject , is that linguistic research normally involves using a tape recorder . federal guidelines require ( so i am told ) a special , and more complex class of review if the data is being taped . in our case , this involves a full committee review , which takes two to three weeks , rather than the ` expedited ' review , which takes only a few days . we are still negotiating on whether class projects need to be cleared class by class ( which we hope ) or instead , student by student . given that students normally take at least half a semester to discover what they want to do , if it will then require an additional two or three weeks to get permission to do it , much linguistic classroom research may get halted . i would be greatly interested in hearing from people on the list who have been able to persuade their human subjects committees to issue any kind of ` blanket ' permission for certain kinds of research . when we suggested this possibility we were told that nobody 's research was privileged , and that if { sociology , psychology anthropology . . . } had to go through the process , so did we . in any case , as a result of my attempting to be law abiding , i almost lost an informant , whose data i had recorded illegally . i asked him to recite the nursery rhymes , then requested permission to do so . shortly afterwards , he left town , never to be seen again . sigh . . . any suggestions on getting expedited reviews , blanket permissions , other speeded up ways of being permitted to tape record linguistic data without supreme court approval would be appreciated . geoff nathan < ga3662 @ siucvmb . siu . edu > southern illinois university at carbondale

Subject: re : 3 . 386 chomsky , mac concordance

it seems to me that for whatever reasons , the fact that there are so many references to chomsky by non-linguists ( let 's ignore the linguists for now ) shows that the field is at least recognized as a legitimate area of intellectual inquiry - - ( after all , even oxford decided a few years ago that they should have a professor of linguistics - - after a long debate to be sure ) this is a cause for exhaltation - - not snyde remarks or comparisons to stalin and mao . and linguists of whatever stripe or theoretical persuasion should recognize that our newly recognized status is due to a great extent to the advent of generative grammar and chomsky . for various reasons i have met a number of nobel laureates over the last ten to fifteen years , and each one on learning i was a linguist asked " do you know noam chomsky ? " and each remarked at some point that he thought chomsky was one of the great intellects in history . a much better response than being asked " how many languages do you speak ? " while that may still be the layperson 's view of our field , it is no longer the view among scientists and academicians across the board . vicki fromkin

Subject: re : 3 . 396 chomsky citations

i ' m neither surprised by the number of chomsky citations , nor their nature , and i do agree that linguistics owes much of its current status to chomsky 's work . however , i do n't think we ought to overemphasize the political citations , since , clearly , the linguistic ones come in droves . and , while vicki 's nobel - prize - winners ' citations speak to this point , let us not shun others that also give our profession honor - - one of my favorites is from woody allan , " the whore of mensa " ( 1972 ) : i ' m on the road a lot . you know how it is - - lonely . . . sure a guy can meet all the bimbos he wants . but really brainy women - - they ' re not easy to find on short notice .

Subject: re : 3 . 396 chomsky citations

i would like to second mark durie 's concerns with what he calls a " pre-generative black hole in modern citation patterns " . it seems a real problem to me that so many of the younger scholars trained in the chomskian school of linguistics are almost completely ignorant of any work done outside that school . on the other hand it seems those who do have a solid knowledge of the history of ideas in linguistics and have an awareness of typological diversity and have worked seriously with a number of languages tend to produce superior work . a prime example is the work of michael silverstein , whose work is grounded on a very thorough knowledge of the work of sapir , boas , saussure , bloomfield , etc . , as well as experience doing detailed work with american indian and australian languages , as well as a good knowledge of work done in the philosophy of language .

Subject: re : 3 . 402 queries : language - speakers , syntax , texts

i would like to address the issue of " who speaks languages ? " it seems to me that this is a big problem . while linguists study structures of various kinds , language teachers study literature , and , if they ' re lucky , pedagogy ( very few graduate schools offer any theoretical orientation to teaching to literature students , which is where most college language teachers come from ) . thus many college language teachers must teach without background ( and with resentment , for some ) while they research in a different area entirely . when some linguists teach languages , they teach structures , not speaking . thus , when taking an unusually-taught language under the auspices of a linguistics department , all we did was talk about structure , we never learned to speak it . talking about language was thrown out many years ago as a way to learn to speak ! neither group , unhappy literature teachers nor structure-happy linguists , are likely to improve the image of language learning in this country . leslie morgan morgan @ loyvax

the folks concerned with speaking a lot of languages would include those directing the mormon missionary effort and those who run the schools for diplomats ( etc . ) assigned to a variety of foreign postings . such people are very clever at developing language skills in their students but in part because they are remorselessly practical ( i . e . anti-theoretical ) . it strikes me that the popularity of language instruction by the intuitive method may explain in part why knowledge of grammar ( any sort of rudimentary grammar ) is no longer very common in the general population . lots of people get a dose of english grammar in middle school , but i wonder if that sort of thing will stick when it simply seems to tell you ( or even to misrepresent ) what you know already . if only seventh-grade grammar teachers could convince their students that it is interesting to see how systematically you behave without knowing it ! but this is the age at which one 's children may raise their voices in protest if you seem to be lecturing them about an area in which they lay claim to adult competence . . . . - - rick

in answer to michael sikillian 's query : i like the analogy between linguists / language and statisticians / data . from a somewhat different , though related , point of view , here is another that i think is apt . many people must do calculations of various kinds now and again ( even given the mechanical aids we now have ) . there is a tendency among the laity to re - gard mathematicians as little more than skilled calculators ; but mathema - ticians are not mere calculators - - rather thay are ( to a degree ) investi - gators of the underlying principles of , e . g . , the number system ( and hence of the methods of calculation ) . one particular respect in which i think the analogy is a good one is this . many mathematicians , though not all , are highly adept at calculation . and many linguists , though not all , are ( a ) polyglots , and ( b ) more than routine - ly adept language learners . and the converse holds as well : there are goiod calculators who are n't much good at math and there are good language learners who can't fathom linguistics ( i know whereof i speak , believe me ! ) i suspect , though i am not sure , that you could take this even further . my experience suggests that most linguists get interested in the field as the result of a second language learning experience - - or at least that such an experience has an important influence on them . and i suspect that it 's also true that many mathematicians developed their interest in the beginning from thinking about what they were doing when they did addition , subtraction etc . since this is advanced as an empirical claim ( carefully hedged ) , data bearing on it is / are most welcome . michael kac

Subject: integration and disintegration in phonological theory

dan everett 's comment on my dissertation ( as i ' ve pointed out to him ) , and by implication on how that work fits into the work of its antecedents , is misleading . dan was for some reason alluding to the fact that in the mit version of the dissertation ( though not the one that has circulated from the iulc or published by garland , which are the ones usually cited ) i mentioned in the acknowledgements that my interest in tone started with reading will leben 's 1973 dissertation : a true fact . but the dissertation itself has a chapter , the first , entirely devoted to the proposition that this work was a continuation of a discussion that has been going on in american phonology since the 1940s ! dan , i think , sees pike as the most important theoretician to cite in that period ; in my writing , i ' ve focused more on bloch , harris , and ( in my 1980 book ) on hockett , rather than pike , but this is more a matter of style and taste than anything else . [ on the same theme , i have a paper coming out ( perhaps it has come out already ) in the journal of linguistics on the genealogical connections between prosodic ( firthian ) phonology and autosegemmental phonology . ] dan has also pointed out that some of the major contributors to phonology during this period who are still very much alive and intellectual active have felt slighted by the lack of citation of their work . as i tried to suggest in my paper on firthian phonology , this is more an indictment of normal human expectations of courtesy than it is the result of people actually forgetting about these phonologists ' good , published ideas ( there is much less of that latter sin than many people wish to believe - - a point that geoff huck and i have made in a recent paper on the relation of generative semantics to current syntactic theory ) . however - - and again from a purely human point of view - - i wonder how many people , like myself , who were publishing material on nonlinear phonology in , say , its first ten years ( 1975 to 1985 ) ever received a note from one of these contributers to the literature in the 1940s and 1950s ? speaking just for myself , i am sure i would have been galvanized to have been dropped a note by . . . any of a number of linguists ; in more recent years , i ' ve had the opportunity to discuss the history of the field , in writing and in person , with a number of these linguists . but i would have been absolutely delighted to have received such a comment , a bit of mild reproof perhaps from an established contributor ( who , now , i can perceive as feeling left out ) . i never did . anyone else ? john goldsmith

( gary marcus and his colleagues at mit have a monograph on this that is not yet out . ) children do tend to produce what they here , at least statistically . 2 ) the assumption is made , in the absence of any data , that children rarely hear adults produce sentences like ( 1a ) above . this is an amazing claim , and i doubt that it is true . 3 ) even if it were true , wyngaerd is making generalizations about learning in the absence of a theory of learning . these last two things are unfortunately very common . why do we think that it 's ok to say , " there 's no data on this , but if there were , i ' m sure it would be x " , and expect people to take it seriously ? or " i have no theory of learning , but i ' m sure that it would n't predict x " ? i ' m a phonologist , and i have n't kept up with changes in syntactic theory , and i ' m sure that i would n't be allowed to get away with statements like " i have no reasonable formal theory of syntax , but if i did , i ' m sure that it could n't accommodate subj-aux inversion , so all theories of formal syntax must be wrong " . but this statement is no different in kind from the other ones . one last statement implicit in much work in linguistics : " i have no theory of genetics , ontogeny , or evolutionary biology , but i ' m sure that if i did , modern linguistic assumptions about innateness would fit in real well .

Subject: rules , innateness , psychological reality

guido vanden wyngaerd ( vol-3 - 395 ) claims that the wh-island constraint is innate . if it is innate , there is really nothing to explain . to vindicate his claim , wyngaerd purports to show that cognitive principles such as analogy make false predictions about how the structure of yes-no questions is acquired : if it were acquired by analogy , one would expect a more or less random distribution over ( 1a ) and ( 1b ) : ( 1 ) a is [ the man who is tall ] _ _ in the room ? b * is [ the man who _ _ tall ] is in the room ? as the reason for this distributional expectation wyngaerd gives this : > given that the main source of evidence on yes-no questions at the child 's > disposal will overwhelmingly consist of simple sentences of the form " is > the man _ _ in the room " , the child could make the generalisation either > in way : in terms of linear precedence ( " front the first finite verb " , > yielding ( 1b ) ) or in terms of hierarchical structure ( " front the finite verb > which follows the subject " , yielding ( 1a ) ) . the fact that children do not > make mistakes in this respect ( ie do not form ( 1b ) ) clearly shows that > the rule is not one learned by experience , the relevant experience not > being rich enough to determine the nature of the rule and not being > able to explain the absence of mistakes . the above passage proves nothing . it would be interesting , indeed , to hear psycholinguists ' opinions about this kind of conjectural psycholinguistics . meanwhile , let me continue conjecturing , for the sake of argument . that " the relevant experience [ is not ] rich enough to determine the nature of the rule " echoes the well-known ' poverty of stimulus ' argument , which has never been proven . in the case at hand , it is easy to conjecture what sort of data / experience is relevant for a child to infer that yes-no questions are formed in terms of hierarchical structure . consider where-questions : where is [ x ] ? [ x ] is in z . is [ x ] in z ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - = - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - = - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - where is [ x who is y ] ? [ x who is y ] is in z . is [ x who is y ] in z ? in principle , analogy works here quite well : the where-question displays the hierarchy which can be analogically extended to other cases . but i am not concerned with whether or not analogy works in this particular case . what i am concerned with is , objecting to wholesale innatism . notice that this does not make me a _ tabula _ rasa _ proselyte . certainly children possess innate cognitive principles and abilities , but from this it does not follow that human beings are necessarily endowed with a grammar as a mental organ ; nor does it follow that the cognitive principles are linguistic or grammatical in nature . it should be clear from my earlier postings that i do not hold that " children only produce what they hear " . so , i concur with wyngaerd 's view that > children do not hear > forms like " buyed " , " eated " , or " goed " , yet they all go through a stage > where they produce these forms . this can only be because they make > generalizations ( rules , if you like ) , which go beyond what they hear . i expect wyngaerd to concur with me that forms like " buyed " , " eated " , or " goed " are due to analogy . > as far as the rest of nyman 's remarks is concerned , i still fail to > see how and why they motivate a distinction between grules and lrules : in his _ knowledge _ of _ grammar _ ( 1986 ) , chomsky speaks of rules as follws : " it might be appropriate to describe the way a sheep dog collects the flock , or the way a spider spins a web , or the way a cockroach walks in terms of rule following , with reference to underlying " competence " consisting of rules of some sort . . . " ( 239 ) . if you think this is analogical to linguistic behavior , you won't need recognize the conceptual distinction between social norms-of - language ( l - rules as objects of common knowledge ) and theoretical generalizations as formulated by a linguist ( g - rules ) . g ( rammatical ) rules need not be psychologically real , but if they are supposed to be psychologically valid , this means that g - rules are supposed to describe what the internalized rule must consist in ; no one knows how " brain rules " are represented ( mentalese ? ) . martti nyman department of linguistics , university of helsinki , finland

" let me comment on how one becomes a linguist . michael kac writes : > i suspect , though i am not sure , that you could take this even further . my > experience suggests that most linguists get interested in the field as the > result of a second language learning experience - - or at least that such an > experience has an important influence on them . this might be true for many linguists . i would like to generalize this observation : it seems to me that many linguists have entered the field because at some point in their lives they have had trouble with using language or with communication in general . this could have been while learning a ( first or ) second language . this could have been because of growing up in a multi-language environment or because of a physical handicap such as stutter . linguistics then serves as a ( formal ) tool to compensate for this deficiency . i can vividly remember how i struggled with german punctuation rules in 6th grade and how i felt relieved when i began to understand the structure of sentences and how this knowledge could be applied to find the correct spot for commas , etc . this started my interested in linguistics and that is how i ended up as a ( computational ) linguist . i 'd be very interested to learn if there is more evidence for my hypothesis . martin volk * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * martin volk * university koblenz - landau tel ( + 49 ) 261-9119 - 469 * institute of computational linguistics * rheinau 3 - 4 fax ( + 49 ) 261-37524 * w-5400 koblenz , germany email volk @ brian . uni-koblenz . de * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

when our graduate seminar in linguistics of asl was preparing to videotape deaf native signers , at berkeley in the late seventies , our " informed consent " forms had to specify what uses we might eventually make of the tapes and data and request the subjects ' assent to them . one aspect of that experience bears on the question of adults with low literacy . we all wrote our own forms . one member of the seminar focused on the legal and contractual nature of the document and wrote a very legalese text , in the formal style distinctive of laws and contracts and incorporating many of the obscure and highly formal archaisms often noted therein : - ) . ( example made up from memory : " . . . whereas the party of the first part may at some future time herein unspecified desire to exhibit such tapes . . . " ) . another student , keeping in mind the low english skills of many deaf people , wrote a form that tended to short , conversational statements and questions ( " . . . i may want to show parts of these tapes to other linguists so i can tell them about the things i find out about asl . is that ok with you ? please initial : yes _ _ _ _ or no _ _ _ _ . . . . " ) the consensus of the group was that the second style was much preferable . it 's perfectly possible to be precise without being complex or obscure , and a document that your subject can't understand runs a great risk of obtaining consent without providing information . i ' m not sure how we handled the issue of subjects unable to understand even a simple - english form , or whether it came up . we may have had a certified interpreter explain it to the prospective subject and discuss it to be sure the subject understood , while videotaping this whole discussion , and having the interpreter start by explaining that we were taping and getting the subject 's consent to that . this tape would then accompany the signed ( = " signatured " ) consent form . mark a . mandel dragon systems , inc . : speech recognition : + 1 617 965-5200 320 nevada st . : newton , mass . 02160 , usa

Subject: closings of academic depts and layoffs at san diego state

on may 13 , san diego state university , facing a probable 8 . 5 % budget cut from state funding , amounting to about an $ 11 million shortfall , announced major eliminations of , and cuts in , academic programs . these cuts entail layoffs of tenured faculty . due to be shut down , with layoff of all faculty , are the departments of anthropology , german&russian , religious studies , natural sciences ( trains high school science teachers ) , family studies & consumer sciences , aerospace engineering , health sciences , and industrial studies . scheduled for cuts of faculty , of varying scale , in within-dept reverse order of seniority , are the departments of french&italian ( 3 of 11 ) , sociology ( 8 of 27 ) , math ( 8 of 60 or so ) , and chemistry ( 14 of 23 ) . the policy is to cut " narrowly and deeply . " although discussion has been going on all year in the senate about the potential for serious funding cuts and ways this university might respond to them , including program cuts , these cuts were announced suddenly , with no prior consultation with the affected departments . official notice to individual faculty members of layoff is scheduled for " mid - june . " > from that time laid-off faculty will have 120 days remaining on the payroll . the athletic department is eliminating golf , track and field , and one or two other minor sports , a cut of about $ 200 - $ 250k . the football and basketball programs are untouched ; the baseball program has lost a number of scholarships ( according to this morning 's sports section of the san diego union - tribune ) . at this point there is no word of cuts in administration . cuts in the school of business have apparently been trivial in comparison with those suffered by the college of arts and letters , the college of sciences , and other colleges . some affected faculty are contemplating legal action , and other remedies are being discussed . three administrative moves may have some potential for reversing the layoffs : cutting ( or eliminating ) intercollegiate athletics , instituting a golden handshake program , and instituting a university-wide salary reduction of up to 10 % . although the union is currently negotiating a golden handshake program , we do n't know how far along the negotiations are and whether it will be possible to put it in place quickly enough to have an effect on the current crisis . there are legal and adminstrative problems with the salary cut . we do n't know whether they ' re surmountable or not . the whole california state university system - - 20 campuses , including the new one at san marcos in northern san diego county - - face the same funding shortfall , but apparently ( we have at this point hardly any information ) campus responses vary a good deal . we ask that you consider writing to pres . thomas b . day , san diego state university , san diego , ca 92182 , expressing outrage at this unprecedented frontal assault on tenure and the centrality of academics to the university . if the attack is allowed to stand , the consequences for higher education within california and everywhere are incalculable . more importantly , we ask that you write to california state legislators and state senators . we will provide names and addresses if you contact us . we would be grateful for copies of any correspondence sent in connection with this crisis . we are sending this information out now , incomplete though it is , in order that linguists may be informed as early as possible in this developing crisis . jeff kaplan charlotte webb ( chair , linguistics and oriental languages dept )

Subject: 3 . 417 citations

i can't resist putting in my tuppence worth on chomsky 's citation record . here are my very informal observations of how he is treated by non ( theoretical ) linguists . ( 1 ) mathematical theory of formal languages . chomsky still gets cited almost automatically for his pioneering work on hierarchies of languages . ( 2 ) philosophy of language . c gets cited a lot for his nativist claims : his arguments are usually rejected . fodor 's much more radical nativism gets even more attention and even more rejection . c also gets cited a lot in discussions of wittgenstein , usually as an example of the sort of narrow formalist , rule-based view a language that wittgenstein consistently argued against . ( 3 ) psychology . c has frequently claimed that what he is doing is scientific psychology , but this has failed to impress psychologists . the competence / performance distinction , the autonomous language faculty assumption and the concern with ug all put c 's theoretical constructs beyond the ken of most experimental or empirical psychologists . ( 4 ) biology . it would interesting to know if * any * evolutionary biologists have taken up c 's views or tried to explain how they could be investigated . again , his views often get mentioned in general introductions . . . but only to be rejected . ( 5 ) cognitive science . as gardner showed in " the mind 's new science " , c was a source of inspiration . consequently he is cited very frequently in cognitive science literature . again , however , it is his formal , comptuational approach - not his genuinely linguistic work - that are referred to . so , although c is viewed as a founder of cognitive science , his current theory of grammar has had no real impact on the field . in general , it seems that most people outside of linguistics know of chomsky as he appears in " aspects " and in the non-technical parts of " knowledge of language " . it 's surely a safe bet that almost no non-linguist followed him into " government and binding " . - philip swann

becoming a linguist - - i am sure there are as many reasons as there are linguists or more . me ? 17 years after my ba , tired of being a diletant and having felt betrayed by the revolution and also guilty about giving the president of my son 's pta a headache every time i raised my hand ( or so it was reported to me ) i decided i really wanted to go back to school but did n't want to do more economics ( my ba ) and one evening at dinner in san francisco at a friends where i met harvey pitkin who was working on wintu ( and his phd at berkeley ) i moaned that i did n't know what i wanted to be when i grew up and he said you should be a linguist and i said i could n't even speak english and he said that does n't matter if i liked to do cross word puzzles and made up secret languages when i wa was a little girl and then he talked about phonemes and morphemes and american indian languages and we finished a bottle of brandy and i decided , why not ? so i applied to the linguistic dept at ucla and was sure they would reject me not knowing any linguistics and having only a 's and f 's on my undergraduate transcript and low and behold they said yes which i am sure was a mistake but that was 1961 and in 1962 i entered th graduate program and in 1965 got a phd and will be eternally grateful to harvey and brandy and ucla and all this is to show how there is no longest sentence . vicki fromkin

Subject: re : 3 . 421 linguists , human subjects

i had the same reaction as martin volk to michael kac 's idea that linguists become linguists because they ' re superior language learners . my gut reaction was that it must be wrong , that we become linguists because we have a hard time learning language , that effortless polyglots pay no conscious attention at all to grammar or any other systems of rules . i was about to offer myself as an example when i realized that i _ am _ a pretty good language learner , but i ' ve always found the process frustrating . i hated learning languages because it seemed so dreary and inefficient until i discovered some shortcuts , namely syntax , phonology , morphology , etc . if my case is at all generalizable , then ( happily ) messrs volk and kac are both right - - we become linguists because we have some skill at language learning , but we are also the rational sort that thinks there must be a better , more efficient way to go about it ( and therefore perceive ourselves as having " trouble " with it ) . am i weird , or did it happen this way for other people ? let 's hear more . mark hansell asian lang . & lit . carleton college northfield , mn usa

Subject: double negation in black english

i am wondering if anyone has done research on double negation in black english in recent years . i am interested in particular in an old claim of labov 's that double negation in be spreads across clause boundaries as in : ain't no cat can't get in no coop as it happens , i believe that labov was wrong and that this example illustrates a different phenomenon , namely , reinterpretation of such structures as consisting of a single clause ( with ' ain't ' becoming a negative marker . and i am looking for any relevant research .

Subject: query : narrative

does anyone know of linguistic analyses of how shifts between narrator and character roles are expressed ? for example , one way is to switch to direct quote . but i ' m looking for cases without dialogue where the writer wants to express the thoughts , feelings , or perceptions of a character , i . e . , the writer wants to present the perspective of the character . while i ' m interested in how the character 's perspective is represented , i ' m even more interested in how the writer uses linguistic devices to show that the text is moving from the narrator 's perspective to the character 's perspective . thanks in advance . wynne janis janis @ purccvm

Subject: accents in classroom

i received a number of helpful and informative responses from a few colleagues and i am grateful to all of them . below please find a digest of the responses . first of all , barbara partee provided the background information on the case itself , which was playing out practically in her own backyard . on july 7 , 1992 , barbara partee ( partee @ cs . umass . edu ) wrote to me : " i ' m keeping an eye on the westfield accent uproar because it 's not far from here and there 's something about it in the paper almost every day , including editorials . i ' ll be glad to help keep you updated on news , and i would appreciate receiving any references you find out about to research that shows that the parents have nothing to worry about . ( an article in a local paper today , about reactions , said in the last paragraph " linguists said that , as long as the teacher is comprehensible , parents concerned about having a good " model " in the classroom to help their children become americanized quickly in their speech have little to worry about . " but no names or references . ) what happened was that early last week a petition signed by 403 residents of westfield , mass . was given to the school board in response to a decision to reassign two bilingual education teachers to positions as normal classroom teachers . the petition urges that no teacher be assigned to first or second grades " who is not thoroughly proficient in the english language in terms of grammar , syntax , and - most important - the accepted and standardized use of pronunciation . " the mayor of the city , a greek immigrant with an accent , and a proponent of english - only laws , and chair of the city 's school committee , has been vocally in favor of the petition . it has been denounced by the state 's secretary of education , piedad robertson , a native of cuba and a former kindergarten teacher herself , who immediately came out with the statement that the proposal " would appear to be discrimination , plain and simple . . . . this petition , instead of fostering the acceptance of cultural diversity , would appear to encourage bigotry , racism , and discrimination . " the mayor in a phone interview june 30 dismissed her attack as " bovine scatology . " the state 's attorney general has offered th opinion that the plan would almost certainly violate the state 's anti-discrimination laws . an article today ( both articles i ' m quoting from are in the daily hampshire gazette , of northampton , though there was also a mention in sunday 's nytimes ) says the mayor , george varelas , says he has been getting calls from all over the country , mostly agreeing with his point of view . the two parents who started the drive are expressing great surprise ; the wife , " who is of spanish and portuguese descent , has become so distraught over accusations of bigotry . . . that she has taken to avoiding people . " the city has about 36000 population and a broad ethnic mix . but like most of what one reads about the english only movement , there 's a great deal of debate about whether it 's racist or xenophobic , etc . , and very little about the fundamental question that you raised , namely does it in fact have any effect on the acquisition of english by the children in the classes ? " throughout last week , i was forwarding the responses to barbara and she was updating the story as things evolved . on july the 8th , she was contacted by a reporter of the westfield paper , and she asked me for ( and , of course , received ) permission to use the materials i had in her interview with the paper . on july the 9th , barbara wrote : " by the way , i heard second hand that the school committee or a subcommittee thereof just voted this morning 3 - 0 not to adopt the petitioners ' request . i ' ll know more by this evening 's news . i expect the newspaper article that our stuff went to will appear tomorrow morning . i ' ll let you know . this is happening quicker , and coming out more emphatically on the right side , than i had expected . " the article appeared on friday , july the 10th , and barbara is likely to post it here on monday . as you will see , the reporter was absolutely fascinated by the fact of the ongoing worldwide discussion of the issue on a computer net . the same issue of the same paper ran a syndicated column by william raspberry on the subject . i have not yet found a paper available here that runs bill raspberry . that was the chronicle , and now for the substance of the responses . a couple of people suggested that the petitioners ' concern was about the teachers being comprehensible to the grade school students . this is , of course , a most legitimate concern , and many states , school corporations , and universities have taken measures to protect their students from incompetent english speakers . apparently , however , this was not the petitioners ' concern , and the core of the issue was their belief that the students would acquire the foreign accent of a teacher . all the responses on this subject shared the conviction that it could not happen . michael covington ( mcovingt @ uga . cc . uga . edu ) : " my own rather limited experience is that children are n't even influenced by the foreign accents of their _ parents _ , much less teachers . " cliff miller ( miller @ defun . cs . utah . edu ) : " of course it is possible [ for a grade school student to be influenced by the teacher 's foreign accent ] , but it is highly unlikely that it will be complete or long-lasting . and perhaps the more important question is : does it matter ? i grew up in several different places and my english has undergone a number of shifts - - i even had a japanese accent for a while . my english is quite native now and i do n't think that the different stages it went through did it any harm . . . . " craig thiersch ( thiersch @ kub . nl ) : " i ' m afraid i do n't have any citations from linguistics literature , and our phonologist is n't here today , but you ' re right : it 's more or less common knowledge that children virtually always acquire the accent of their peers , not that of parents , teachers , or other adults . i can think of countless examples from my own experience : for instance , i used to live in boston , where you can cut the local accent with a knife , and played organ for a church in arlington , mass . , where the pastor and his wife were from the mid - west . but all their children had strong " towny " arlington accents . " amy sheldon ( asheldon @ vx . acs . umn . edu ) : " i was interested in learning that your daughter never acquired the pronunciations of the 3 adults at home , when they differed from , i assume , the local dialect . i can add that our 9 & 12 year olds do not have any of their father 's quebec french pronunciations or translations in their speech and on occasions when they have had his speech forms / usage , they seem to get rid of it when they learn the local dialect . that is , his speech does not persist in theirs . they also recently asked me if i thought that daddy had a foreign accent . they said they did n't think so . i must admit , that i have to stop and think a second before i realize that he does indeed have an accent , and that on reflection , our kids will admit to it too . but there is a sense in which we do n't think on a minute to minute basis of him as speaking differently from us , though certain pronunciations or translations on occasion may strike us noticeably . i 'd imagine that students in a class with a nonnative teacher muight have the same perceptions , esp . if the teacher is fluent in english , although having an accent . this is a good " applied linguistics " example . " the only references that the discussion has yielded so far were contributed by catherine doughty and susan ervin - tripp . catherine doughty ( catherine . doughty @ linguistics . su . edu . au ) : " the ability " to be affected by phonology " seems to be the earliest of thing to go in terms of maturational constraints on language acquisition - - see the work of johnson & newport 1989 in cognitive psychology 21 . j & n set the age of the beginning of the decline at 5 or 6 . another interesting case that is analogous in some ways but not others is the case of simon a profoundly deaf child of profoundly deaf parents . simon 's parents were late acquirers of asl ( learned at ages 16 & 15 ) and so provided non-native and very different versions of asl to their child . they are his only source of input , as simon goes to a " normal " school where no one knows any asl . simon 's asl is comparable to the asl of children who learn asl from native signers - - e . g . , nativelike . ( singleton 1989 dissertation ) . susan ervin - tripp ( ervin-tr @ cogsci . berkeley . edu ) : " it would be nearly impossible for a child to be influenced by the accent of a grade school teacher unless it was the prestige accent of the community , and the child knew it . as labov showed convincingly , kids get their accents from their peers . on the other hand , i ran into some reported cases of children who preserved the accents of their immigrant parents , but these were unusual cases of socially isolated children . for example , in the clinical literature i found a case of an 8 year old who immigrated at 3 , and still had " his father 's accent " . as he was psychoanalyzed ( ! ) he lost his accent , spoke like his peers , and became able to mimic the accent at will . buxbaum , psychoanalytic quarterly , 18 , 279-289 ( 1949 ) .

Subject: workbook

in ' 95 i ' m teaching a unit called descripptive linguistics : morphology and syntax . its one of those 2nd / 3rd yr level units that covers classic a structuralist techniques for analysing and describing languages , introduces students to some of the theoretical and conceptual problems that arise in language description , and exposes students to some of the main types of morphological and syntactic phenomena in languages of the world . its thus mainly descriptive , but with a secondary typological bent , and i ' m sure in this respect it is similar to linguistics units on offer at many universities . as a text i ' m using ( bits of ) the new crowley , lynch , siegel , piau book ' design of language ' which is being published by longman in jan ' 95 . as support material for this unit , i ' m putting together a collection of language data problems as a workbook . in the past i ' ve either concocted my own , or plundered the usual sources ( langacker , stockwell , demers & farmer , etc etc ) but i ' m a bit tired of these and i ' m on the lookout for fresh material . many of you who have been involved in both teaching and language description have probably , like me , developed language data problems for use in assignments and tutorials , etc . 20 so i ' m writing to seek contributions from anyone who 'd like to pool such data . i ' ll happily accept problems in phonology , but i ' m particularly interested in morphology , morphosyntax and syntax . i 'd like the workbook to have an australian / asian / pacific regional bias , but not so strong as to stifle typological diversity , so i ' ll welcome useful material from any language anywhere . contributors will be acknowledged in the text ( as in sample below ) and will receive a free electronic copy of the completed workbook . i 'd like any contributions before mid - jan , and the completed workbook will be posted to you at the end of feb . my immediate intention is to create a student resource manuscript for ' 95 , but if subsequent publication seems desirable , i ' ll recontact contributors to seek their permission . if you are interested , here 's a list of topics as a prompt , and a few guidelines . 20 / 80 grammatical categories , noun class / gender , tam distinctions , polarity , transitivity , causatives , voice , pre - / suf - / in - / simul - / supra-fixes , replacive / zero / subtractive morphs , compounding , redup , morphotactics , inflection / derivation , conditioned allomorphy , abstractness in morphophonemics , clitics , case distinctions , concord , word order , adpositions , verb serialisation , co-ordination , subordination , complements , relativisation , problems that highlight the adequacy / inadequacy of insertion / movement rules , etc etc 80 provide the language name , and a short language description ( as in sample below ) . 80 data emaile to nreid @ metz . une . udu . au as an attached document , keyed in times 12 and iparoman 12 fonts , will simplify my job , but good data scrawled in blood on paperbark will do if it 's legible . 80 if you use an established orthography instead of ipa , provide a key to the orthography ( as in sample below ) . sample format ( a dangerous exercise within eudora - please allow for its limitations ) problem 1 ngan ' giwumirri [ contributed by : nicholas reid ] description : 20 ngan ' giwumirri is spoken by about 20 people in the daly river region 300 kms southwest of darwin in the northern territory of australia . it is a non - pamanyungan language with an elaborate noun class system and complex polysynthetic verbal morphology . 20 question : 20 the ngan ' giwumirri data below illustrates the morphological marking of membership in two noun classes . describe the semantics of these two noun classes , and their morphology , noting any allomorphy that you find . can you argue convincingly for an ' underlying form ' for either class marker .

Subject: language requirements for teachers

a few weeks ago i directed a query at linguists ensconsed in english departments . i wanted to know what the language course requirements ( i . e . , intro to ling . , history of english , etc . ) were for english majors , particularly those planning to be high school or elementary school teachers . i only got a half-dozen replies . thanks so much to those six . out of the six universities represented by the six respondants , two required six credits ( two courses ) for both english majors and english majors who intend to teach . the other four require only three credits for simple majors , but six for those who intend to be teachers . armed with this information i went to the curriculum committee prepared to defend our current six credit requirement for students seeking a teaching certificate . there had been a proposal introduced to reduce it to three . i made my case for about five minutes . when i was finished , the other members of the committee looked at each other , shrugged , and withdrew the proposal to reduce the language requirement . victory .

urgent action appeal : re : the unhonorable discharge of dr . arief budiman from university of satya wacana , salatiga , indonesia dr . arief budiman , one of the most consistent defenders of freedom of speech in indonesia and an outspoken critic of indonesian government , was fired from his position as a senior lecturer in the post graduate department at the christian university of satya wacana ( uksw ) , salatiga , indonesia . the letter of dismissal that will take effect on october 31st , 1994 , was issued on october 17th , and was cosigned by prof . haryono semangun ( chairman ) and drs . nelky oemboe nganggoe ( secretary ) of the university 's board of trustees . the letter said that dr . budiman has been unhonorably discharged because of not following the critique ethics adopted by the university . he was also accused of circulating issues discrediting the university 's board of trustees and rector . what dr . budiman actually did was only publicly expressing critical opinion againts the board 's controversial decision on the appoinment of the new rector , dr . john ihalauw . previously , dr . budiman received two letters of reprimand from the board , but no specific " misconduct " was mentioned in both letters . two additional notes must be mentioned . first , over the year the board has been under constant pressures from the majority of the faculty members , students , and administrative staffs of the university to revoke the appointment of the new rector , which was considered illegitimate . the same academic community has expressed public support for dr . budiman 's initiative to file a lawsuit againts the board . secondly , all of this is taking place as an increasingly sweeping clamp - down of intellectual activism has been heightening in the past two weeks , presumably in preparation for the upcoming apec summit in jakarta this november . there is a possibility that this dismissal was also intended at punishing dr . budiman and closing his opportunities to continue expressing his criticism to the indonesian authorities . in a separate case , dr . george junus aditjondro , another uksw 's lecturer and a close friend of dr . budiman , is still under police 's interrogation for insulting the state authorities while speaking in a seminar in another campus . this arbitrary measure againts dr . budiman has demonstrated how such an academic institution as uksw has violated the principles of freedom of speech and has threatened the democratic atmosphere within the academic community . his dismissal will be detrimental not only to the world-wide known reputation of uksw as one of more committed universities , but also to the dynamic of indonesia intelectual and academic life as well . as members of academic communities and individuals who are concerned with the maintenance of freedom of speech , we should express our concern to this arbitrary action . please send letter , fax , or make a call to the board of trustess of uksw for : - expressing concern at the unhonorable discharge of dr . arief budiman - asking the board to reconsider the decision and to give dr . arif budiman an opportunity to defend himself in front of the university 's senate and academic community in general . mailing address : prof . dr . ir . haryono semangun ketua umum dewan pengurus yayasan perguruan tinggi kristen satya wacana ( board of trustees satya wacana christian university ) jl . diponegoro 52-60 salatiga 50711 indonesia phones : ( 62 ) ( 298 ) - , 81362 , 81363 , 81364 fax : ( 62 ) ( 298 ) 81420 telex : 22364 ukswsa ia for more information , e-mail : amrih widodo at awidodo @ facstaff . uwisc . edu heri akhmadi at jpnn @ clark . net

Subject: re : 5 . 1205 linguistics and imperialism

for what it is worth , i remembering hearing somewhere that the old persian empire used to employ a number of translators who were competent both in the imperial language and in the language of their region to carry messages throughout the empire . presumably , this was somewhat similar to the british empire where imperial functionaries used to receive additional payments when they had passed appropriate exams in local languages . an old family friend who was district commissioner for some part of uganda used to sit in court regularly overseeing cases in customary law which were always conducted in the vernacular . these were not languages that were necessarily well-known in the fco , although he had to make regular reports back to london . although he would not have described himself as a linguist , it would seem that his work depended on an amount of ( pre-theoretical ) linguistics . tony bex

it 's probably true that linguistics tends to thrive in circumstances of imperialism , but the reason is not that linguistics is inherently imperialistic by nature . when does linguistics happen ? when a society with a literate culture comes into contact with peoples speaking other languages , and takes an interest in them . imperialism provides one situation in which this can occur , but not the only one . bob hoberman rhoberman @ ccmail . sunysb . edu

given the current vigorous linguist vs linguistician debate , another potential title in the arena might not be terribly welcome , but at least it could , for a while , divert attention away from the existing debate which seems to be languishing ( i . e . getting nowhere ) . a friend of mine who is a medic suggested the nominalized form ' linguistic ' ( ' i am a linguistic ' ) , based on the model of medic / cleric . i suppose ' medic ' and ' cleric ' can occur as nominal forms on account of the derivational gap left by ' medical ' and ' clerical ' . however , ' linguistical ' has been cited , so perhaps we could shift everything across one derivation , thus allowing the sentence ' we linguistics enjoy linguistical questions ' . i hesitate to suggest ' linguisticine ' as the name of our subject . a r linn department of languages and linguisticine , u of luton

Subject: re : 5 . 1196 corpus analysis of - body / - one

it seems to me altogether possible , even likely , that there is the following interaction , namely , that the particular lexical form < everybody > has come to acquire , for many speakers certainly ( me , for instance , a quasi native speaker , and i share ellen prince 's intuition concerning her sentence # 1 ) a distinctly collective sense , whereas < every - one > maintains , again for these speakers at least , a distributive sense , at least as a living option . thus 1 ' . everybody came , bringing their respective wives . seems especially good , though , oddly enough maybe , this instantiates the special claim that , for this particular lexical - body item , the formal / informal register distinction has at least contextually ? ) collapsed . now , it seems plausible , but no more than that in the present state of knowledge ( or of ignorance ) that there is a more underlying interaction , namely , that there may be something more naturally colloquial about using a collective rather than a distributed plural when an option presents itself . actually , this follows from an algebraic , non - fregean view of quantification , which i have written on but cannot go into ion this message , save to indicate summarily that it is a capital mistakme to imagine that , for instance , the same semantical reopresentation ought to apply , even for logico-deductive applications , to say , < each / every > and < all > , respectively . thus , invoking a correspndence that i shall not unpack here , i . everybody brought their wives / * everybody brought his wife i ' . they all brought their ( respective ) wives / each man brought his wife . ii . * each man brought their wives / they each brought their ( respective ) wives . this surely suggests , does it not , that the interaction under review is distinctly asymmetrical ( or , i think , rather , non-symmetrical ) , for , the < each > form of quantification , by logical entailment of a fairly obvious kind ( from the distributed , that is , serial , meaning , to the collective / mass , can take a collective sense , whereas the reverse ( you cannot non-arbitrarily unpack a mass b ecause there is no algorithm in this direction correspnding to the seial addition inherent in the other direction ) is not available . all , then , ( and the other collective-sense quantifiers and the nominals that condense such quantifiers ( as in the body cases ) quantiify , i . e . , select as a choice function , over a power set , choosing the element equivalent to the improper 's ubset of the whole ' . each - type quantification is over the elements of a set , taking the index ' i ' ranging , algebraically , successively from 1 ( or , in some cases , 0 ) to n , the cardinality of the set in question . f . k . l . chit hlaing

Subject: summary : taps / flaps

taps / flaps : summary : not long ago i asked about dialectal variation in english taps ( sometimes called flaps ) for < t > . many thanks to the thirty or so respondents , who i will name only where i cite them . * environments * there was general agreement that the trager description was not ( or , possibly , was no longer ) accurate , although one respondent suggested that his description might fit southern us accents better than northern ones . flapping / tapping of a word-final < t > before a stressed syllable is possible for most of those who responded . some varieties are reported to be leniting the flap further , possibly to zero . various speakers , however , had noted flaps / taps in other people 's dialects which sounded odd to them , eg in words like _ button _ and _ eighteen _ . both of these seem to be ok here ( at least on iambic-reversal 18 ) . the most thorough suggestion came from ian mackay : > an intervocalic t or d is flapped as long as the following syllable ( ie , > the syllable containing the second of the two vowels that the t or d is > " inter " ) does not carry primary stress , and that the second vowel does > not carry significantly more stress than the first vowel , and with > the proviso that word boundaries may block the phenomenon ( but do n't > ask me to specify the nature of those word boundaries ! ! ! ) . one ( british ) respondent said that in their dialect , tapping / flapping seemed to be lexically determined , not determined by phonetic environment , so that a flap / tap was possible in _ witty _ but not _ pretty _ , in _ british _ but not in _ skittish _ . and don churma brought in the spectre of morphological conditioning , which might also account for the examples above : > in fact , there are still further details that most folks > seem to be unaware of , like the relevance of " level 2 " morpheme > boundaries ( cf . my flapped / t / before the secondarily stressed / i / in > ( deadjectival ) " elitism " vs . aspirated / t / in ( denominal ) " magnetism " ) . at least all these different aspects of the problem make it clear why it is so hard to describe properly . * syllable - final , syllable-initial or ambisyllabic ? * alice turk reports that her experiments suggest that an ambisyllabic analysis is the most explanatory . this is also reported as the solution used by kahn . other respondents argued for syllable-initial ( on the grounds that for them syllable-final was always glottalised ) or syllable-final ( on the grounds that voiceless taps / flaps also occurred , but only in clear syllable-final position or that clearly syllable-initial / t / s were always aspirated ) . as john harris remarked : > as to the coda-vs - onset issue , i ' m sure you 'd agree , the competition is not > going to be resolved by simply inspecting the data ( or even listening to it ) , > since codas and onsets are not present in them . it 's a matter of comparing > the two theories . i could n't agree more , especially since i am aware of conflicting definitions of ambisyllabicity in the literature on dependency phonology . * references : * harris , john 1990 phonology 7 , harris john & kaye 1990 the linguistic review harris , john 1994 english sound structure ( blackwell ) chapter 4 jensen , john english phonology , kahn , daniel , 1976 syllable - based generalizations in english . dissertation . olive , j . p . , a . greenwoord , & j . coleman . 1993 . acoustics of american english speech . springer - verlag picard , marc ( 1984 ) " english aspiration and flapping revisited " . canadian journal of linguistics 29 : 42-57 . turk , a .

Subject: summary : basic order ( and remarks on typology )

last week i asked for references to discussions of a problem that comes up in linguistic typology : when there are conflicting or ambiguous criteria for deciding whether a particular language is a particular ' type ' with respect to some feature ( word order , clause alignment , or whatever ) , how does one decide how to assign that language ? i would like to thank the following for their helpful replies : george huttar , yehuda falk , dan everett , larry trask , jon aske , mike maxwell , mark newson , bill croft , georgia green , ingo plag , randy harris , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy . i was quite surprised at the small amount of published attention that there is to this problem . i was pointed to short discussions ( no more than a couple pages ) in some of the major works devoted to typology : the seminal greenberg paper , comrie 's ' language universals and linguistic typology ' , croft 's ' typology and universals ' , and hawkins ' ' word order universals ' . it was also suggested that i look at doris payne 's ' the pragmatics of word order ' and to papers on yagua by payne and dan everett and on tzotzil by judith aissen . what prompted my query was a reading of johanna nichols ' linguistic diversity in space and time , which i found extremely impressive . but all through it i had an uneasy feeling caused by her pigeon-holeing languages as ' svo ' , ' head-marking ' , ' active-stative ' , or whatever . since so many languages are * not * transparently one particular ' type ' on the surface , i wondered what the basis for these type-characterizations was . there is no general answer given to this question for an obvious reason : neither nichols or anyone else could have profound first-hand knowledge of more than a small handful of the 174 languages in the data base . i suspect that in most cases nichols could not know what criteria were applied to type a language in the sources she consulted , because many sources are insufficiently explicit on that point or take as self-evident some categorization that another would take as controversial or simply wrong . ( consider , for example , her typing french as vso . ) there were , to be sure , cases where nichols threw out some language from the sample of some particular feature because of its obvious ambiguous status with respect to that feature . but doing so could have created more problems than it solved . as both aske and croft pointed out in their postings to me , if a language is ' inconsistent ' with respect to a particular feature , that too is typological data ; data moreover that could be highly relevant to conclusions about stability and diversity over time . in a sample of 174 languages , misassignment of several languages within a category with a 3 - way division could lead to rather different conclusions . likewise , so would postulating a different set of categories or having categories specifically for ' mixed ' types . this is beginning to sound like a critique of nichols , but i do n't mean it to be . rather , it is more a commentary on the shaky art of typological pigeon-holeing that underlies not just conclusions about language prehistory , but also much functionalist theorizing and - - increasingly - - generative theorizing as well . there is also the question of sample * size * . typologists strive , quite reasonably , to correct for genetic and areal biases in their samples ( the most heroic effort along these lines that i know of is dryer 's work ) . but how confident can we be of any attempt to eliminate bias from the sample , given nichols ' conclusions that influences can extend half-way around the globe ? and does n't that present a challenge to purported explanations of the relative frequency of some typological feature , which are common in the functionalist literature and increasingly so in the generative ? so much could be the result of historical accident on the one hand and contact and descent on the other , rather than the product of ' external ' functional forces or the design of ug . the smaller the sample of languages where mutual influence or common descent is not a possibility , the more likely that some implicational typological relation is artifactual . and the more reason we have to think that there are a lot of typologically possible but - - purely by chance - - nonexisting languages . fritz newmeyer fjn @ u . washington . edu ps : with respect to the last point , alan bell has shown that if some feature appears in 1 % of the world 's languages ( say , 40-50 languages ) , it will show up only about 50 % of the time in a random sample of 75 languages . you 'd need a sample of over 200 languages before it could be counted on to show up 90 % of the time . and we are assuming here , utterly counterfactually , that there are no genetic relations or areal influences between languages .

i recently asked , as i do periodically , if anyone knows of speakers who have different vowels in _ rider _ and _ writer _ ( i . e . , who have canadian raising , so called , for the diphthong / ai / ) but who use the vowel of _ rider _ in the second syllable of _ typewriter _ . i received a fair amount of mostly irate comments from people who thought this was impossible . however , i have found one speaker ( who happens to be a linguist but not a phonologist ) who has this pronunciation . as it happens he is not from ontario , but from illinois , but i believe that his existence strengthens the case for the hitherto purely hypothetical account i have proposed of how joos came to " invent " the non-existent ontario dialect in which supposedly _ writer _ and _ rider _ were homophonous . a careful reading of joos shows that the only example he actually cites is _ typewriter _ , not _ writer _ ! i thus believe that there must have been more speakers who said _ writer _ with a higher vowel , but both _ rider _ and _ typewriter _ with a lower one than my sole informant , and that this sporadic pronunciation is what led to the birth of the whole myth about rule ordering in canadian english , which persists till now as the example of crucial rule ordering in the phonological literature . it may not be as glamorous as the eskimo snow word myth , but there it is .

Subject: sum : dets and number

about a month ago , i posted the following query : i ' m looking for languages whose nps have the following three properties : ( 1 ) bare , unmarked nouns occur in argument position , and may be interpreted as either singular or plural ( eg . malay , mandarin , japanese , as opposed to english ) ; ( 2 ) at least some determiners are unmarked for number ( eg . english " the " , " some " , " john 's " , as opposed to " this " , " these " ) ; and , most interestingly , ( 3 ) when a bare , unmarked noun occurs in construction with a determiner that is unmarked for number , the resulting np * is * marked for number . so far , i am familiar with two languages satisfying the above three conditions . ( both are singaporean dialects of languages whose standard varieties do n't satisfy these conditions . ) singaporean malay ( 1 ) like in standard malay , bare , unmarked nouns are unmarked for number , eg . " kucing " ( cat / cats ) ; ( 2 ) again like in standard malay , the determiners " itu " ( that / the ) and ini " ( this ) are unmarked for number , eg . " seekor kucing itu " ( that / the one cat ) , " dua ekor kucing itu " ( those / the two cats ) ; ( 3 ) unlike in standard malay , bare , unmarked nouns in construction with " itu " and ini " tend to be interpreted as singular , eg . " kucing itu " ( that / the cat / ? * cats ) . [ apparently , there is some variation here between speakers , and between different constructions for the same speakers . ] singlish ( aka colloquial singaporean english ) ( 1 ) unlike in standard english , bare , unmarked nouns are unmarked for number , eg . " cat " ( cat / cats ) ; ( 2 ) like in standard english , prenominal possessors such as " john 's " are unmarked for number , eg . " john 's one cat " ( john 's one cat ) , " john 's two cat ( s ) " ( john 's two cats ) ; ( 3 ) when bare , unmarked nouns are preceded by prenominal possessors , the resulting construction can only be interpreted as singular , eg . " john 's cat " ( john 's cat / * cats ) . some questions : ( a ) is anybody familiar with more such examples ? ( references ? ) ( b ) is this a southeast asian areal feature and / or a common cross-linguistic pattern ? ( c ) in both of the above cases , an unmarked noun plus an unmarked determiner results in a singular np . are there any cases where the result is a plural np ? ( d ) does anybody have any ideas how to analyze / explain this phenomenon ( within any theoretical framework , or none ) ? * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * this is one case where the summary is much shorter than the query itself . two other languages emerged with a pattern identical to that of singaporean malay : japanese ( thanks to pamela a downing and mayumi masuko ) , and korean ( thanks to jae jung song ) . ( in the meantime , further field work of my own revealed that in singlish , not just prenominal possessors but also the definite article " the " exhibits a similar singularity effect : although unmarked for number ( as evidenced by " the one cat " , " the two cat ( s ) " ) , " the cat " is interpreted as singular . ) further observations were provided by steven berbeco , richard dearmond , bob fradkin , mark a . mandel , edith a . moravcsik , and gwyn williams .

Subject: icla call for papers

4th international cognitive linguistics conference july 17 - july 21 , 1995 , albuquerque , new mexico * aims and scope the international cognitive linguistics conference offers a forum for research within the perspective of cognitive linguistics . this perspective subsumes a number of concerns and broadly compatible theoretical approaches that share a common basis : the idea that language is an integral part of cognition which reflects the interaction of cultural , psychological , communicative , and functional considerations , and which can only be understood in the context of a realistic view of conceptualization and mental processing . topics of interest for cognitive linguistics include the structural characteristics of natural language categorization ( such as prototypicality , metaphor , mental imagery , and cognitive models ) , the functional principles of linguistic organization ( such as iconicity and naturalness ) , the conceptual interface between syntax and semantics , the experiential and pragmatic background of language-in - use , and the relationship between language and thought . in addition , topics of special interest for the 1995 conference include cross-linguistic studies and cognitive linguistic approaches to signed language research . * conference site the 1995 conference will take place on the campus of the university of new mexico ( unm ) in albuquerque . albuquerque lies between the foothills of the sandia mountains ( with peaks of more than 10 , 000 feet ) and the west mesa ( which is dotted with the cinder cones of long-extinct volcanoes ) ; dividing the city is the winding rio grande valley , famous for its bosque nature preserve . at an altitude of roughly 5000 feet , the university campus enjoys warm summer days and cool nights . excursions to nearby pueblos , santa fe , and the sandia mountains are being planned . also taking place at unm during the summer of 1995 is the linguistic society of america 's biennial linguistic institute . under the direction of joan bybee , li-95 will run for six weeks from late june to early august and will include over 50 courses taught by visiting faculty as well as special lectures . the conceptual structure for li-95 applies cross-linguistic comparison and a functional orientation to the major areas of linguistics and the language emphases of the university of new mexico program : signed languages , spanish , and native american languages . several other conferences are planned to precede and follow the 1995 icla conference . * submission of abstracts authors are requested to submit four copies of a one-page abstract in hardcopy format to the address below . abstracts must be received before november 30 , 1994 . authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by february 1 , 1995 . sherman wilcox / icla95 department of linguistics university of new mexico albuquerque , nm 87131

Subject: re : 5 . 1225 linguistics and imperialism

with regard to hoberman 's comment . it would not make sense to say that linguistics is inherently imperialistic in nature , any more than it would for any other science , since linguistics is multi-faceted and has many purposes , some now well established and others continually evolving , e . g . , " forensic " applications of linguistics etc . since language is universal , applications for linguistics are universal . in my earlier comments i dwelt on diversity among languages because that 's where the connection between linguistics ( mainly as an aid to learning and teaching languages ) and multilingual empires ( = " imperialism " ) is easiest to see . however , i also noted that there are people who are interested in language and linguistic diversity for its own sake . i suspect that this is universal . although it may be reflected differently in different cultures . maybe the universality of interest in language and linguistic diversity is reflected in myths about the origin of such diversity , or other kinds of " pre-linguistic " explanations . among cultures which seem particularly ethnocentric to me , classic athenian culture perhaps was less encouraging to interest in other languages than most cultures ( with the us perhaps close behind but also with a complex fear and insecurity about languages other than english ) . nevertheless , we see from plato 's cratylus that differences between greek ( in its various diachronic forms ) and the " barbarian " languages was put to philosophical use . if you read cratylus , you ' ll see that plato , through socrates , was putting some value on philosophical arguments which brought in data from other languages . ( even though there 's a lot of sarcasm and tongue in cheek in the whole issue as plato treats it in cratylus , i . e . , whether the words of language are " natural " or " conventional " / are there " correct " words for ideas / concepts / things ? - - plato is always a polemicist , reacting to rival schools of thought . ) i would like to re-open the issue ( i think it was once opened before on the list ) about how different cultures " explain " language diversity , and whether there is a culture which prevents all individual members from being interested in language for its own sake . i do n't think that could logically be possible - - but what do i know ? in any case , this might give us some insights into the " prehistory of linguistics " , and also into the still present motivations of some linguists to attach themselves to this aspect of our culture . benji

Subject: lx as * science * ?

i accept the editors ' recent challenge for resuming last year 's thread ( which i missed , before subscribing ) on whether linguistics is / should be considered a science - - by which i am assuming everyone means newtonian * science * rather than the quantum / relativity science which has been current during this century . [ n1 ] . i will argue 1 ) that while much of our work is * scientific * , much of our work goes beyond the traditional definitions of * science * ; 2 ) that being categorized solely as * science * is to our long-term professional detriment ; 3 ) that we are uniquely positioned to aim higher . academics over the centuries have used various prestige words when desiring to assert their rigor . * scientific * is such a word today , and has been a prestige word since the early 1800 's when it replaced * philosophical * as the term academics use when indicating some ultimate in rigor and truth . and well before that , in seventh-century rome , boethius and others used * logical * as their prestige word . [ n2 ] i ' m confident this is not the sole reason for most linguists ' claim that linguistics is a * science * . but for those few for whom it is : saying it 's * rigorous * is sufficient to describe that side of our work . perhaps instead our discipline is looking for professional prestige and advancement in academe , and aligning politically with * science * is seen as the best strategic move . [ n3 ] is this a reason ? if so , perhaps we can talk together about it out loud rather than it remaining as a professional assumption . but there are other reasons we might consider giving up * science * as a label - - including our unique perversity in cultivating the process of working with meaning . a physicist friend once told me that if physics had to deal with the dimension of meaning ( s ) as well as everything else it deals with , physics could no longer be a science . [ greg derry , personal communication ] . newtonian physics was long held as the model of hard * science * , and all of its principles exclude ( d ) meaning . but so do the principles of 20th - century physics . is any linguist ready to give up meaning ( including the systemic meaning of structure ) in order to be * scientific * ? is linguistics not at least as much art as science ? can anyone provide me a good reason for categorizing linguistics as science in the context of these remarks ? is n't there something more inclusive we can aim toward ? but where 's our model in the social / soft sciences ? actually , linguistics is the best potential candidate for such a new , meaning-full model of science . other disciplines have been watching us for decades . after all , we train in our methodologies for a very delicate balancing act in consciousness between form and meaning ( i . e . , when doing historical work , we compare forms even from other languages , but we can't stop with that - - we must also be aware whether they have changed semantic categories , etc . ) . this is what some in other disciplines would call a systems approach , which goes beyond modern structuralism [ n4 ] . like the complementarity principle in physics , form and meaning in linguistics are complementary ( not polar ) opposites , both necessary for the total system to work properly . alas , our own theories are another matter . because of the terminological shackles of a meaning-less * science * that some would place on our discipline , we continue to use the dead metaphors of that meaning-less * science * in our attempts at meaning-full theory building . [ n5 ] notice how we have historically treated those who urged us to move our theories to the level of our methodology - - to the level of systems thinking : which describes a world of uncertainties and mutual interdependencies rather than mono-certain anything ; or chaotic ' attractors ' pulling events toward them into material manifestation [ n6 ] , instead of one thing directly causing another . whorf took one step , in transforming einstein 's relativity principle from the more limited geometry focus to the larger focus of human language in general , which he called the linguistic relativity principle . [ n7 ] that physics has in this century been dealing with deep linguistic questions has unfortunately been lost on most linguists . and the deeper mergers of language and philosophy have been ignored for universalist perspectives in the latter half of this century [ n8 ] . and linguistics departments are closing as the rest of academe ruthlessly renders its own self-serving judgement : linguistics is becoming irrelevant , a " pseudo-science " , in the late 20th - century . please understand : i am in no way against the * scientific * mode of linguistics - - it is uniquely appropriate to studying form . it is not , however , appropriate to studying meaning , for obvious reasons . the answer is not to let the part overwhelm the whole such that our entire discipline becomes * scientific * , but to accept the challenge and develop theories and principles of a meaning-full science that other disciplines will so admire that in the 21st century they will start claiming to be * linguistic * as a way of claiming ultimate rigor in their search for truth . * * * * notes : [ n1 ] i assume this because of the way all the social sciences treated whorf , who was attempting to tell them that the very definition of * science * / science was changing underneath their certainties . if it were otherwise , we would n't need this discussion . [ n2 ] dineen on boethius : " logic became the prestige study of the day , the medieval 's most precise and respected intellectual tool . it held the same position in the intellectual world then that science holds now : serious study today must be 's cientific ' - - then it had to be ' logical ' " . [ n3 ] however , as one christian de quincy wrote recently , " [ m ] ost scientists do not recognize the limits of science , nor do they want to . there is a power given to the society that supports science . if one were to take the power and possession [ of science ] away from the corporations and politicians , what would be the standing of science in society ? " [ n4 ] . . . and what some consciousness anthropologists would call a 's hamanic stance ' , balancing with a foot in both worlds . eastern philosophers would probably talk about the interpenetration of yin and yang within the tao , as david bohm found out in his dialogues with j . krishnamurti . [ n5 ] including such pre - relativity / quantum * scientific * vocabulary as ' cause ' and 'd etermine ' ( especially when linked , as in monocausal determinism ! ) . we even try to project these dead * metaphors onto people using systems thinking ( e . g . , sapir , whorf , pike , lamb ) . [ n6 ] per current chaos theory in mathematics , for those who like to use mathematics in their linguistics theories . [ n7 ] einstein also had the larger language issues in mind , which he talked about in a 1941 radio speech ( " what is it that brings about such an ultimate connection between language and thinking ? . . . the mental development of the individual and his way of forming concepts depend to a high degree upon language . this makes us realize to what extent the same language means the same mentality . " ) . [ n8 ] there is so much more that needs to be done in interesting areas such as how reason and logic and philosophy grow out of the grammars of languages . most are not aware , for instance , that the word ' karma ' - - long before it was a term of eastern philosophy denoting the process of what goes around comes around with emphasis on the ' comes around ' experiential phenomena - - was a term within the system of sanskrit linguistics meaning 'd irect object of verb ' [ james ryan , sanskrit & philosophy scholar , personal communication then presentation at society for the anthropology of consciousness , 1992 ] . what might a well-articulated philosophy of animacy from native american languages look like ? - - moonhawk ( % - > ) < " the fool on the hill sees the sun going down and > < the eyes in his head see the world spinning round " > < - - john lennon >

Subject: . . . . . use hypnosis to make money !

hi . my name is dennis . i am a third-generation , professional hypnotherapist with over 22 years experience . i also , like many of you , spend a bit of time online . like you , i get hit by all sorts of mail either promoting sex sites or promising untold riches . being practical , i know multilevel marketing makes a lot of money for some people . . . the ones at the front end , at the beginning . but all the ones i have seen advertised are either the same one or clones of each other . i am sure you know the one i am talking about . i know people are still making money with it , or there would n't be so many advertisements . but they are n't making much , for two main reasons i can see . first it is the same , tired program that was old when i first went online a couple of years ago . anyone starting now would be at the tail end rather than the head . second perhaps more importantly . . . that program doesn ' t sell anything that people really want ! they wrote up some reports full of information that you probably either already know or do n't care about , just so they would have a product to sell . i have a solution . offer a product that people want to buy ! i have written clear , easy-to - read reports on self-hypnosis . most people have things they want to improve about their lives . many of these things , including stress , weight control , and smoking , can be taken care of with hypnosis . but people have good reasons why they do n't go to a hypnotherapist to take care of them . one is cost . even though being healthy saves money in the long run , people look at the short term expense and decide against it . another is pride . who wants to admit that they needed help from someone else ? it is almost like going to a psychiatrist . even though it is nothing to be ashamed of , it is still something few people want to admit . now people can learn how to take care of many of their problems themselves ! not only will they save money , they will have a sense of pride in being able to do it themselves . i am sure you have heard someone say before , " i lost 15 pounds " or " i quit smoking . " they are proud of what they have accomplished . i keep saying " they " because even though you will be able to use this knowledge for yourself , you will make your money by selling the reports to the many people that are also interested in hypnosis . with that other program i mentioned people have made a lot of money selling something nobody really wants . think how well you could do selling a product that is actually worth it ! i am trying to keep this email short , but want you to think about something else . i have seen multilevel emails that had the following : 1st level - 10 members with $ 5 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 2nd level - 10 from each of those 10 ( $ 5x100 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 500 3rd level - 10 from each of those 100 ( $ 5x1 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 5 , 000 4th level - 10 from each of those 1 , 000 ( $ 5x10 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 , 000 total $ 55 , 550 if they expect that much participation in a program that old , could n't you expect twice the participation per level ? getting 20 people instead of 10 for each level would make you $ 842 , 100 ! the first three reports teach how you can hypnotize yourself to improve you life . the fourth shows how to set up your email , how to get it out to others , and other tips and strategies you can use to be a success . i want you to be a success , because each person who replies to you , asking for report 1 , will also be replying to me asking for report 2 . then , when those people contact customers , you will be receiving money and orders from people you did n't even have to contact ! they will be advertising for you ! i am now going to list the reports and the addresses to order them from . just think , your name is going to be at the # 1 position , the one that makes the most money , when you send out your emails . report 1 : general information on self - hypnosis & relaxation and stress relief the perfect combination po box 798 chepachet , ri 02814 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 2 : weight loss rvp po box 190 wahiawa , hi 96786 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 3 : quitting smoking & other uses and tips for self - hypnosis s . franco po box 623 bonsall , ca 92003-0623 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 4 : turning it into a business j . destefano box 20793 1303 e . university blvd . tucson , az 85719-0521 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ordering instructions : * order each report from the person whose address is under the report title . you will need all 4 reports , because you will receive orders ( and money ) for each one , as your name travels down each of the 4 levels . * each report costs $ 5 . 00 cash . imagine receiving 100s of $ 5 . 00 checks a day , wondering which ones have cleared , and which ones have n't . you can see why cash is a necessity . the money should be wrapped in 2 pieces of paper , concealing it to prevent theft . * on one sheet of paper you should include the name & number of the report you are ordering , your email address , and your postal address . please write clearly . if your email address have parts that can be confused , i . e . 0 vs . o , l vs . i , etc . , please specify which it is . * the report will be sent to you as quickly as possible after your order is received . it will be sent as an attached document via email , unless there is trouble with your email address . the postal address will then be used as a backup . * make sure you save each report as you receive it , so you will be ready to send it out as you start receiving your orders ! * as i mentioned earlier , instructions on how to set up the email for you to mail out are on report 4 . for now , it would be best if you saved this email , so you will have it to work with later . finally , i want to remind you that this is a legitimate business . you should treat it as such when you enter it . you can talk to the small business administration if you need help in starting your business . you will of course need to pay local and federal taxes on the money you make . but since it is money you would n't have had otherwise , giving a little of it to uncle sam won't hurt . please contact the internal revenue service for any questions you have concerning applicable taxes . even though i am confident that a little effort will make you a success in this business , i can make no guarantees and none should be implied . actual profits made may be lower , equal to , or exceed the amounts mentioned in this letter . i would wish you luck , but i do n't feel luck is as important as making good decisions and having determination .

hello , my name is kevin elphick and i am the managing director of nursing innovations which have been manufacturing and supplying a range of innovative wound dressing protectors named ' keep - dri dressings ' to australian hospitals for a period in excess of 8 years . these internationally award winning products are now extensively used in over 70 % of western australian hospitals ( references available upon request ) and we are now looking at supplying to hospitals internationally . however , we have found from experience it is difficult to initially introduce the product to hospitals . once a hospital starts using keep - dri dressings they have always continued to use them . our success is related to the fact that they are quick and easy to apply ( saving staff time ) and they really work . the result is lower infection risk , reduced patient trauma and lower cost for the hospital . for your free sample contact me at my web site http : / / www . angelfire . com / ca2 / nursingone here you will find a full product description , uses and advantages and a link to my email address . i would appreciate any suggestions you might have to help introduce this excellent product into hospitals in your area or comments you have on our product . many thanks in advance . kevin elphick nursing innovations 23 yulema street mullaloo , perth , western australia 6027 618-9487 - 1807 http : / / www . angelfire . com / ca2 / nursingone * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * k

this is really a two fold question . let 's talk about the selling of report # 5599 first . all you have to do is place an ad , mail the postcards or send bulk email . if you place an ad send the respondent this sales letter and let this sales letter do the rest for you - no need to talk to anyone ! ! if you mail the postcards or use bulk emailing your job is done ! the postcard will ask the respondent to send $ 50 . 00 to your mailing address . email will work for you if you send it to as many people as you can . if you decide to become an offshore broker and qualify to receive over-rides and commission on the offshore business support services the parent company will do the selling for you if you wish . this is a " no brainer " and can be as simple or as complicated as you want to make it . . . talk to the people if you wish or do n't - report # 5599 sells itself ! q . how many hours a week will i have to devote to my business ? a . one to sixty hours a week ! here 's a question i will answer with a question . . . how much money do you want to make ? common sense says the more ads you run and the more mailings you do the more money you will make ! the statistics show that for every 100 responses you receive from your ads , and you mail this sales letter , you will sell five to ten reports making you $ 250 . 00 to $ 500 . 00 ( us ) . your ad responses will vary depending on the place you advertise and the circulation of the publication . the more ads you run or the more emails you send out the more time you will need to devote to your home based business . q . just how much money will i need to start my home based business ? a . $ 50 . 00 ! yeah i know - you ' re thinking you will need money for ads and mailing . well - i ' ve had people start with $ 50 . 00 ( u . s ) and make ten copies of the report and sold them to their associates and friends giving them $ 500 . 00 ( us ) . that gave them enough money to start running ads and to buy stamps . in looking at all the money making opportunities offered in the world today i really do n't think you can get started for any less than $ 50 . 00 and have a better legitimate money-making opportunity than the one offered in report # 5599 ! q . if i have additional questions who will answer them for me ? a . i will or the parent company will ! no package of information , no matter how complete , can possibly answer every question that may come up . i do not want you to lose money seeking out the answers . i want you to succeed ! you will receive a phone number in report # 5599 where you can either reach me or someone from the parent company for any question or help you need ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ here 's a valuable bonus for ordering within 5 days . . . . your 's absolutely free !

Subject: hi !

* * * this is not spam ! * * * my name is matthew . i make a habit of deleting mail i have not yet read , as i ' m sure you do also . please read this one though , you might find this interesting . i recently lost my high paying job from a major computer corporation due to their loss of a major contract . they messed up , but that whole dep ' t of 15 people including myself are hung out to dry . corporate america at it 's finest . i have not had luck yet finding another job , as my skills were very specific to that company and not really worth anything to another company . during the time i worked there , i also bought and sold real estate like those guys on tv . ( yes , you can do that and make it work for you too ) the key is i made it work . i was fairly successful until the " nightmare on pleasant st . " as my freinds and i call it . . . i lost most of my money in that one bad deal and i was no longer financially secure and i relied heavily on my income from my former job . as you ' ve already heard , i lost that too and i started to look for other things i could make money to help me get back on my feet . so , i started to read all of the junk that people have mailed to me . let me tell you , i can't beleive some of the things out there . . . what a waste of time . until i saw this . hold on . i know you are ( like i was ) ready to stop reading right here . i implore you not to . i ( like you ) am not some non-educated fool . i have made much money for myself in real estate , which is not an easy business . i am a rather competent business man . at least finish reading this until the end . * * better still : print this letter and read it in comfort over , and over here is what i saw . . . * i only needed $ 20 extra dollars to try this * this is making money for people who at lease tried a little , so why not me too ? in desparation , i sent the four 5 dollar bills and got the reports . as i always have , i made this work for me too . i took much time and effort to learn about e-mail ( which is a great and free tool ! ! ) and how to send lots of it . now , 19 days after my first mailing of this , i have received roughly 8 , 450 responses . ( trust me , when my fiance ` saw 8 , 450 5 dollar bills on the kitchen table , she no longer laughed at me for trying this ) i wrote a report of my own showing step by step how to do the same which i will give to you for free as a helping hand so we can all continue this success . i will show you every step of cutting , pasting , editing this letter to include your name and address , etc . here is my special offer to help you . . . . as long as my address , basquiat at the evanston po box is on the list below i will send the step-by - step instructions and 100 , 000 e-mail addresses to anyone who orders any report from me . it took some time and expense to put this list together so all i ask is that you add another $ 5 for handling the addresses . the instructions for e _ mailing are free . they will come to you in a . txt format ( which i will teach you how to use in the instructions i ' ve put together ) and less than 2 % will be duplicates . you will get the list of addresses with your report . the first 160 people who order a report from me will receive a different set of addresses . this is my gift to you to help you get started . . . . i promise you , if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up ( and count your money ! ) , you will make at least as much money as i am . you do n't need to be a whiz at the computer , but i ' ll bet you already are . if you can open an envelope , remove the money , and send an e-mail message , then you ' re on your way to the bank . take the time to read this so you ' ll understand how easy it is . if i can do this , so can you ! add this e-mail to ' favorite places ' by dragging the heart at the upper right corner of this window to the heart / folder picture next to the file cabinet . that way , you will have a copy of this for future use . go for it now ! ! matthew the following is a copy of the e-mail i read : $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ this is a legal , money-making phenomenon . print this letter , read the directions , then read it again !

" i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i " knew " it would n't work . doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old " i told you so " on her when the thing did n't work . . . well , the laugh was on me ! within two weeks she had received over 50 responses . within 45 days she had received over $ 147 , 200 in $ 5 bills ! i was shocked ! i was sure that i had it all figured and that it would n't work . i am a believer now . i have joined doris in her " hobby . " i did have seven more years until retirement , but i think of the " rat race " and it 's not for me . we owe it all to mlm . frank t . , bel - air , md the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 . 00 in the first 14 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , phillip a . brown , esq . not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n't get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i surprised when i found my medium - size post office box crammed with orders ! for awhile , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i ' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n't matter where in the u . s . the people live . there simply is n't a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program . . . 11 months passed then it came . . . i did n't delete this one ! . . . i made more than $ 41 , 000 on the first try ! ! d . wilburn , muncie , in this is my third time to participate in this plan . we have quit our jobs , and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it . for your sake , and for your family 's sake do n't pass up this golden opportunity . good luck and happy spending ! charles fairchild , spokane , wa order your reports today and get started on your road to financial freedom ! ! !

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to " forge " headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the " to " " from " and " reply to " portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / 138 . 27 . 44 . 5 . cearth . on . ca / users / imc ( if you can't log into the site just call us , sometime the site is overloaded with hits ) call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our " global remove list " simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately
